<p><strong>Individual Trade Agreements (EU)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The world map on the previous page shows the Trade Agreements with whom the EU has Trade Agreements of one form or another – the map simplifies the distinction between the types of agreement, as the distinction is not relevant to the management of the regulations in the UK tariff. Even the EBA distinction makes zero difference to how data is managed.</li>
<li>Below is a list of the 40 blocs with which the EU has agreements (Vietnam expected in 2020). Some of these agreements incorporate trading blocs or more informally grouped countries - these groupings are discussed below. Some are special (looking at you Iceland and Norway). </li>
<li>Though Trade Agreements happen rarely and do not creep up unannounced, they are likely to be time-consuming to implement.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94458763-47794800-01ae-11eb-9266-80ddbcc0ec18.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94458763-47794800-01ae-11eb-9266-80ddbcc0ec18.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

        </table>
      </div><p><strong>What do Trade Agreements contain?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>There are really only two major entities that trade agreements contain: tariff preferences and tariff rate quotas.</li>
<li>These are the core components of a Trade Agreement and the vehicles by which Tariff barriers are removed and reduced.</li>
<li>It is also possible that trade agreements also include some restrictions and may also feature supplementary units, but these are minor components.</li>
</ul>

<ins>Preferential tariffs / tariff preferences (either works)</ins>

<ul>
<li>These allow traders to import goods from an overseas nation at a reduced or zero duty rate, provided they can prove that the goods are materially derived from that nation, according to the rule of origin described in the associated legislation.</li>
</ul>

<ins>Preferential Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs)</ins>

<ul>
<li>Preferential TRQs are included in over half the trade agreements that we will be carrying over to the UK: typically it is the EPAs, which are either full EBA or close to EBA that do not have quotas, as the duties are already 0%</li>
<li>TRQs and tariff preferences on the same commodity code are perfectly possible – for example in the Peru trade agreement, there are both tariff preferences and a quota on pork products (e.g. commodity 0203295520)</li>
<li>It is down to

<ul>
<li>a) is there quota balance available?</li>
<li>b) how they complete their SAD form</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Individual commodity codes may belong to multiple quota order numbers (e.g. Kosovan wines belong to multiple preferential quotas)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules of Origin</strong></p>
<p>The EU (and in the future the UK) has rules for establishing the country of origin of imported and exported goods. Traders need them to classify goods manufactured in more than one country.</p>

<ins>Defining the origin</ins>

<ul>
<li>There are 2 main categories of origin in the rules:

<ul>
<li>goods wholly obtained or produced in a single country</li>
<li>goods whose production involved materials from more than one country</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The second category is the more complex as there are several criteria to consider – e.g. the origins of the materials, the country in which the final substantial production phase took place and the value the working and processing in each country has added.</li>
<li>If a product is manufactured entirely in the EU and is exported to a country with which there is a preferential arrangement it may attract lower or nil rates of duty when it is imported into the destination country.</li>
<li>If some of the components are manufactured in the EU but components are added and the product is assembled in another country it may be judged that the product originates from the country where it is assembled. The duty requirement will depend on the arrangements between the country in which the product was assembled and the country into which it will be imported.</li>
</ul>

<ins>Proof of origin</ins>

<ul>
<li>Traders who want to import goods at a reduced or nil preferential rate of duty (for bi-partite or unilateral preferences) must get proof of origin in the form of a EUR-1 or EUR-MED certificate, which needs to be completed by the exporter and presented to the border authorities at export and import.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules of origin and the tariff</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Oddly, there is very little in the Tariff that requests a proof of origin.</li>
<li>One would have expected all measures from preferential agreements to be linked to proofs of origin, but they are not</li>
<li>One less thing to worry about</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concept - staging</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The first thing to say is that the term “Free Trade Agreement” is often used optimistically to refer to any kind of preferential trade agreement. The term free trade suggests complete removal of tariffs on all goods, which, even in Everything But Arms Economic Partnership Agreements (EBA EPAs) / Generalised System of Preferences for Least Developed Countries (GSP LDC) is not the case.</li>
<li>But freer trade and de-tariffication is the ultimate goal of Trade Agreements.</li>
<li>This is usually achieved via a process called staging.</li>
<li>Staging can be applied to both tariff preferences and to tariff rate quotas in slightly different ways.</li>
</ul>

<ins>Preferential tariff staging</ins>
<p>Trade Agreements will often aim to decrease tariff barriers over a number of years, in order to build in some protection for domestic producers. A common scenario is for a period of reduction to be set (e.g. 4 or 5 years), over which the duty rates are reduced from the prevailing MFN to</p>

<ins>Tariff rate quota staging</ins>
<p>Alternatively, many trade agreements contain recourse for preferential quotas where the volume of goods permitted into free circulation at a reduced in-quota rate increases by a set amount per year, as specified in the regulation that underpins the quotas.
The ultimate (but not quiet achievable) goal is to remove tariff barriers entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Staging of tariff preferences</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>To the right are two fragments from the EU / Singapore Trade Agreement: the prose talks of the theory behind what is to be achieved and the split of commodities into staging categories. The table illustrates a set of commodities that are assigned to a given staging category and a bare rate from which the rate will reduce</li>
<li>For category 5 commodities, as per bullet (b), “customs duties on originating goods provided for in the items in staging category ‘5’ in a Party&rsquo;s Schedule shall be removed in six equal stages beginning on the date this Agreement enters into force, and such goods shall thereafter be free of any customs duty”</li>
<li>Both the ad valorem and specific duties are reduced in roughly equal chunks over the course of the reduction period. Here is an example from Colombia, where the staging has just run its course (product 0402109100). The jumps are not quite equal though – you cannot programme for this!</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94462728-db014780-01b3-11eb-9d85-cab1df40a4c4.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94462728-db014780-01b3-11eb-9d85-cab1df40a4c4.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Staging of tariff rate quotas</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Contrary to tariff preference staging, the aim of TRQ staging is not quite to get to absolute zero, though in some cases the quota can disappear altogether at the end of a specified period.</li>
<li>This differentiation between choosing quotas and preferences and, by extension, staging in the two, depends on the sensitivity of the goods in question and the presence of domestic suppliers.</li>
<li>The fifth column in the Trade Agreement reference document for Colombia (right) shows the modification that is made to the quota, i.e. more volume is made available per annum at 0.00% duties, with the overall net effect that tariff barriers are removed (when volume permitted exceeds likely trade flow).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>FTA regulations are almost always wrong</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Trade Agreements can take years from inception to ratification and operationalisation. Once they are published, potentially even in draft form, they are rarely if ever re-opened.</li>
<li>To the right is the same screen grab of the EU / Singapore trade agreement used earlier in this deck. Singapore Trade Agreement went live in November 2019.</li>
<li>The red marquee shows the digits CN13, meaning that the commodity codes used in the legal document and its tariff schedule are from the EU’s Combined Nomenclature of 2013 (6 years before actual go-live).</li>
<li>This is because the FTA has been negotiated since March 2010 and the negotiations on goods and services were completed in 2012.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94463026-40553880-01b4-11eb-9e59-8d58f2145800.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94463026-40553880-01b4-11eb-9e59-8d58f2145800.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<p>The moral of the story is – don’t go looking in EU Trade Agreements for the gospel truth – they are almost always out of date.</p>
<p>The situation much worse with older agreements, such as Switzerland, where virtually no commodity codes in the legal text match the reality.</p>
<p><strong>The Trade Agreement Continuity (TAC) Programme</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The TAC (or Trade Agreement Continuity) programme in DIT has been run since the Referendum with the sole purpose of ‘rolling over’ as many of the existing EU trade agreements into the UK as possible.</li>
<li>The approach of rolling over Trade Agreements, i.e. not changing anything substantive, was seen as a necessary expedient, due to the shortage of time, and also to try to avoid potential challenges at the WTO, whose members would undoubtedly feel the need to scrutinise anything more than ‘technical changes’, or small changes to numbers</li>
<li>So, given there are two aspects to trade agreements, preferences and quotas, the UK is keeping preferences largely as-is and modifying quota balances to be more inline with the UK’s part of the bigger EU share.</li>
</ul>

<ins>Working out quota balances</ins>

<li>In general a calculation is made of three years’ worth of quota usage in the UK and the EU to determine what size of quota pot should be assigned to the UK.</li>
<li>For example, if it was found that over three years, the UK used 15% of the EU’s overall allocation on the quotas in a trade agreement, and a given EU’s quota was 1 million tonnes, then the UK’s equivalent quota would be 150,000 tonnes.</li>
<li>This quota coefficient is worked out on an agreement-by-agreement basis, rather than quota-by-quota. Thus, that 15% would apply to all quotas in an agreement if 15% is the mean.</li>
<li>Not all quotas are considered relevant to the UK – expect a number of quotas to drop off completely if there has been no or little use of them by the UK.</li>

<ul>
<li>The EU trade relationship with the EEA (European Economic Area) is complex and very different from how the UK will treat its members.</li>
<li>For a start, EEA from a trade perspective contains Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The EU countries themselves are also members of the EEA, though, being part of a single customs area, the duties and most regulatory controls do not apply.</li>
<li>The UK will treat Liechtenstein exactly as it treats Switzerland and will not treat it as part of the EEA, with which we will have no all-encompassing relationship as a trading bloc.</li>
<li>It is not clear what the position of the UK in relation to the EEA will be in the future.</li>
</ul>

<ins>Existing EU measures for Iceland and Norway</ins>

<ul>
<li>Iceland measures are assigned to three different geographical areas, as follows:

<ul>
<li>2012 – European Economic Area</li>
<li>2014 – European Economic Area (Iceland)</li>
<li>IS – Iceland</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Norway measures are assigned to two different geographical areas, as follows:

<ul>
<li>2012 – European Economic Area</li>
<li>NO – Iceland</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is up to the trader to enter the origin of their choosing when declaring the import: they will usually choose the most preferential import duty</li>
</ul>

<ins>What the UK intends to do</ins>

<ul>
<li>The UK aims to simplify the relationship with these countries, but doing so is a complex data challenge.</li>
<li>The rule is that we adopt the most preferential rate from the options, and apply that, shelving the ‘worse’ options.</li>
<li>This is more complex that it sounds, due to the fact that the duties are applied at multiple levels in the category hierarchy and inherited down, thus the work we need to do to work out the ‘best’ duty requires us to expand the duties through the full hierarchy and essentially assign duties at end-line level, before raising the duties back up as high as possible in the hierarchy to reduce the data imprint and future management overhead.</li>

<h3 id="tariff-preference-measures">Tariff preference measures</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tariff preference measures are assigned to commodities using measure types:

<ul>
<li>“142” Tariff preference and</li>
<li>“145” Preference under end-use (authorised use)1</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You will find that trade agreements come in a very wide variety – from the EBA-style agreements (the EPAs) to the complex agreements such as Israel and Canada which come with all sorts of duty permutations.</li>
<li>The tariff manager will need to adopt different data management strategies to manage these different types of agreements:

<ul>
<li>a Fiji or Cameroon agreement could be completed in minutes, whereas Canada could take several days</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Please review the document on measure components for information on how measures are constructed</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="preferential-quota-measures">Preferential quota measures</h3>
<ul>
<li>Preferential tariff measures are integrated using the two measure types:

<ul>
<li>143 - Preferential tariff quota</li>
<li>146 - Preferential tariff quota under end use</li>
</ul></li>
<li>See the section on quotas for more information on what makes up a quota</li>
<li>End use quotas are applied to a very restricted range of commodities currently:

<ul>
<li>Tomatoes, cucumbers, fish, tomatoes, herring, cane or beet sugar and plum purée</li>
<li>Each of these is accompanied by the condition for a EUS - Authorisation for the use of end use procedure certificate</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
