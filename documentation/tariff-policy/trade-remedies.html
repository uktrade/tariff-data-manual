<h3 id="introduction-to-trade-remedies">Introduction to Trade Remedies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Trade Remedy is the name given to defensive trade instruments that can be used to protect domestic industry against illicit trade activity by overseas nations or companies, or to protect against a sudden an unexpected glut of goods entering the market.</li>
<li>Trade Remedies come in three flavours:</li>
<li>Anti-dumping duties</li>
<li>Anti-subsidy duties (aka countervailing duties)</li>
<li>Safeguards</li>
<li>Safeguards have some similarity to the agricultural safeguards (e.g. representative prices for chicken, the Entry Price System), in that they are not put in place to punish illicit behaviour, rather to act as a pressure valve, should international market flows suddenly change and, thus, threaten domestic industry.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties are quite similar, therefore should be dealt with together. Both are put in place to protect domestic industry against uncompetitive behaviour by overseas business.</li>
<li>Anti-dumping duties may be applied when an overseas business is found guilty of ‘dumping’ its product on a foreign market at a price which is lower than it would have been sold on its own domestic market, and that dumping has been found to cause injury to suppliers in that overseas market, who could lose market share as a result.</li>
<li>Anti-subsidy duties may be applied when an overseas is found to have gained an unfair advantage in international commerce through illegal state subsidies, which allow the company to market their goods at a distorted low price, again threatening the viability of international rivals.</li>
<li>The processes for managing through anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases are also very similar and will be dealt with together in this guide.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Safeguard duties</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Until 2018, safeguards were extremely rare. Then the current President of the United States set out on his protectionist approach to boosting US industry by applying punitive duties to goods coming into the country from abroad.</li>
<li>World trade is a fine balance – any drastic change in activity (pricing, demand etc) from one significant party will affect the trade flows throughout the world – this happened with steel and related metal products from 2017 onwards, when USA whacked 25% duties on imports of steel from major exporters.</li>
<li>The net effect of this was that suppliers of steel, which previously had a fertile market in USA had to find alternative buyers. Europe became the next market, and the knock-on impact was to damage EU suppliers’ viability.</li>
<li>Therefore the EU put in place, from early 2018 onwards, a set of safeguard measures to attempt to restore a pre-Trump balance of trade. These took the form of a combination of a 25% additional duty (to be charged over and above the MFN or any preference applied duty), which was then moderated by the application of quotas to certain goods that were made available to specific countries, such that the EU could take advantage of a given volume of ‘cheap’ imported products without wrecking businesses across the EU’s industrial heartlands.</li>
<li>Do not confuse safeguards with retaliatory duties, which display many overt similarities – see separate guide.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Relationship with the DDaT / TRA Trade Remedies Case Mgmt System</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>DDaT has also constructed a dedicated case management application for use by the TRA in managing a Trade Remedy case from initiation to completion.</li>
<li>While the subject matter is the same, there is no data link currently between this application and Tariffs.</li>
<li>While at the end of the investigation, the TRA would construct a document containing recommended punitive tariff duties to be forwarded to the DIT Secretary of State for a yes / no decision, this is effectively offline: a document is constructed with a management summary, leading then to a public notice which is then posted on gov.uk.</li>
<li>The TRA will be expected to complete a pro-forma (essentially an Excel spreadsheet) describing to the MTPO team the duties they have agreed to impose</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Trade Remedies cases</strong></p>
<p>Trade Remedies cases are rare, but when they happen, they are significant chunks of work, both for the investigating authority and, ultimately, for the Tariff Manager. As an average, in the EU, there are c. 10 new Trade Remedies cases investigated through to conclusion annually, which sounds small – but the impact on the tariff is drastic.</p>

<ins>The TRA / TRID</ins>

<ul>
<li>While we are a part of the EU, the UK has no authority or team to investigate anti-dumping / anti-subsidy complaints: all such activity is undertaken by the relevant Trade Defence organisation within the European Commission.</li>
<li>When we leave, this trade defence role will be taken on by the Trade Remedies Authority (TRA). At the point of writing, the TRA has not been formally instituted: the intention had been to create an Arms’ Length Body, affiliated to but completely independent of the Department for International Trade. The legal vehicle through which the TRA was to be formed (The Trade Act) is yet to be passed, therefore the TRA exists in an intermediate state, still as part of DIT under the guise of the TRID (Trade Remedies Investigations Directorate) - the evolution into the TRA is expected in 2020.</li>
<li>Until the end of the Implementation period, which could be as early as Jan 1st 2021, the UK will remain as a part of the EU’s Common External Tariff and, as such, will not be able to impose its own punitive duties, however the ability to investigate cases starts on Feb 1st 2020 – we are going to begin by reviewing the duties imposed in the EU cases that we are retaining</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Initiating cases</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Article 5 of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement and article 11 of the WTO Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Agreement state that investigations can only be initiated following a written application by or on behalf of the domestic industry.</li>
<li>For an investigation to proceed, the companies requesting that investigation must account for more than 25% of total domestic production of the product in question</li>
<li>Their output must also exceed that of domestic producers that expressly oppose an investigation.</li>
<li>They must also provide preliminary prima facie evidence of dumping, injury and causation.</li>
<li>Unless these conditions are met the investigating authority cannot initiate a case, without being subject to the risk of a legal challenge by the exporter’s home country. There are no related provisions dictating how the initiation of safeguards investigations should work.</li>
<li>However, trade remedy investigation authorities can initiate cases without this application (ex-officio initiations), in special circumstances but there must be sufficient evidence of dumping or a subsidy, evidence of injury, and a causal link between the two.</li>
<li>Ex-officio initiations are possible in the EU and most other comparable countries, with the exception of New Zealand.</li>
<li>However, none of these countries have ‘self-initiated’ cases via their investigating authority except in exceptional circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investigation methodology</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>When an investigation is initiated, WTO Agreements set out the parameters for the investigation and the evidence that should be gathered. Within these parameters, the UK Government intends that the investigation methodology should be objective and transparent when: 

<ul>
<li>establishing the level of dumping (in anti-dumping cases), </li>
<li>determining the impacts of a subsidy (in anti-subsidy cases) </li>
<li>identifying unexpected surges of imports (in safeguards cases) should be objective and transparent </li>
<li>determining injury (or serious injury in the case of safeguards), and the causal links.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Determining measures</strong></p>

<ins>Provisional Measures</ins>
<p>Provisional measures enable countries to prevent injury being caused to a domestic industry while the latter stages of a trade remedies investigation is being carried out, subject to certain conditions, as follows:
  * an investigation has been initiated and all parties have been given the opportunity to submit information and make comments,
  * the preliminary findings suggest that dumping has taken place or a subsidy exists, causing injury to a domestic industry, and
  * provisional measures are considered necessary to prevent injury while the remainder of the investigation is being conducted.</p>
<p>The Agreements also state that provisional measures cannot be applied before 60 days after the initiation of the investigation, and must be taken for the minimum time possible and not normally exceeding four months. In anti-dumping cases, provisional measures can be applied for up to six months where exporters representing a significant amount of the trade involved request it. In cases where a lower duty is applied than the margin of dumping these periods can be extended to six and nine months respectively.</p>
<p>Provisional safeguard measures can also, under article 6 of the WTO Safeguards Agreement, be applied in critical circumstances where there is evidence that an unforeseen surge in imports have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury to a domestic industry. The duration of the provisional measure in a safeguards case is not allowed to exceed 200 days. The duration of any provisional measure counts towards the total period for which the safeguard may apply.</p>
<p>Within the framework set out by the WTO, provisional measures can be applied at different stages in the investigations process. For example, the US applies them after they have received data from respondents in an investigation, but before that data has been verified. The EU applies them after verification of the data has taken place. There is a balance to be struck between providing early protection for the domestic industry, and setting provisional measures at the appropriate level based on sound data.</p>
<p>If the investigation fails to find a justifiable case for the application of trade remedy measures, the investigation is terminated and provisional duties have to be repaid. On occasion, provisional duties imposed on an exporter are lower than definitive duties. In these cases the exporter is required to top up the difference. Similarly, any duties imposed as a result of provisional safeguard measures have to be promptly refunded to the exporter if the subsequent investigation does not determine that increased imports have caused or threatened to cause serious injury to a domestic industry or were not unforeseen.</p>
<p>For anti-dumping cases, provisional measures may take the form of a provisional duty or a security - by cash deposit or bond - equal to no more than the amount of the anti-dumping margin provisionally estimated. For anti-subsidy cases, provisional measures may take the form of provisional countervailing duties guaranteed by cash deposits or bonds equal to no more than the amount of the provisionally calculated amount of subsidisation. For safeguards, provisional measures should take the form of tariff increases.</p>
<p><strong>Concluding Trade Remedy Investigations</strong></p>
<p>Once a final determination has been made in a trade remedies investigation, definitive measures can be applied. These are usually in the form of duties, undertakings, or occasionally in the form of tariff rate quotas (particularly for safeguards). These measures are applied at the border by HMRC.</p>
<p><strong>Undertakings</strong></p>
<p>Undertakings can be an alternative to anti-dumping duties or countervailing measures (definitive or provisional).  In the case of dumped imports, these are generally price undertakings, whereby an exporter enters into a voluntary agreement to revise the export price of their product or cease exporting at dumped prices so as to eliminate the injury caused. In the case of subsidised imports, an exporter or the exporter’s government enters into a voluntary agreement to: a) eliminate or limit the subsidy or take other measures concerning its effects; or b) raise the export price of their product so as to eliminate the injury caused.  Undertakings do not apply in relation to safeguards. </p>
<p>Where undertakings are used, WTO rules set out procedures to follow.  Undertakings may only be offered or sought after a preliminary affirmative determination of dumping and injury caused.  When an undertaking is accepted, investigation proceedings may be terminated unless either the exporter (in anti-dumping cases) or exporter’s Government (in subsidies cases) want the investigation completed or if the investigating authority so decides.  If a negative determination of dumping or injury is subsequently made, the undertaking normally lapses.  If an affirmative determination is made, the undertaking remains in force.</p>
<p>There are no tariff measures that are placed as a result of undertakings</p>
<p><strong>Reviewing cases</strong></p>
<p>The decision to impose trade remedy measures has significant repercussions, both for the exporting industries whose business models will be directly impacted by the measures imposed, and for domestic industries and other interested parties within the receiving country. It is important, therefore, that a mechanism exists to review the measures in place, and that this mechanism is clear, transparent and effective, and allows measures only to continue as long as they are necessary.</p>
<p>Article 11 of WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement contains provisions relating to the duration and the review of measures. In the case  of dumping and subsidy, measures should remain in force no longer than is necessary to counteract the injury caused, and cannot be in force for longer than 5 years without being reviewed. Any review should normally be concluded within 12 months. In the case of safeguards, if the duration of the measure exceeds three years, then it should be reviewed not later than at the mid-point of the measure.  . Any measures in place for over 1 year should be progressively liberalised and no measures should be in place for more than 8 years in total.</p>
<p>In order to abide by these WTO requirements, the UK Government intends to create a trade remedies review process which is consistent with the approach to new investigations.</p>
<p><strong>Monitoring cases</strong></p>
<p>2.7.1   Circumvention &amp; Absorption</p>
<p>Circumvention and absorption both refer to practices which are designed to avoid anti-dumping or anti-subsidy duties and, if left unchecked, will undermine the effect of trade remedy measures.</p>
<p>‘Circumvention’ refers to a process through which an exporter subject to anti-dumping or countervailing measure duties, or an importer liable to pay the duty, attempts to evade that duty through particular practices. In some instances these practices will be fraudulent activities for which there are separate HMRC enforcement provisions. Circumvention can take several forms including slight modifications of the product, transhipment via a third country, or assembly of the product in either a third country or the importing country with minimal value added.</p>
<p>Duties are said to be ‘absorbed’ when, after anti-dumping or countervailing duties have been imposed, export prices decrease or the resale prices of the imported goods do not increase sufficiently, resulting in the measures not having the expected effect of restoring competitive prices.</p>
<p>The WTO Anti-Dumping and Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Agreements make no specific provision for circumvention or absorption reviews.  Most other countries’ trade remedies systems specify processes for reviewing cases and extending the anti-dumping measures as appropriate to tackle circumvention. For absorption, different trade remedies systems tackle the problem in different ways depending on the way in which duties are collected at the border of the country or region in question.</p>
<p>The UK Government intends to create an efficient and effective trade remedies framework should be robust enough to tackle these sorts of practices, which undermine the intended effect of the measures.</p>
<p><strong>Migrating cases</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>As per the earlier note on migrating cases, for an investigation to proceed, the companies requesting that investigation must account for more than 25% of total domestic production of the product in question. Their output must also exceed that of domestic producers that expressly oppose an investigation.</li>
<li>These criteria also apply when considering the migration of trade remedy cases from the EU to the UK. At the end of the implementation period, we will only transition the cases that meet these thresholds and which are seen to be in the public interest to maintain.</li>

<li>This table illustrates the current usage of measures within the UK (as shown on the UK Trade Tariff Service) related to Trade Remedies in descending order of usage</li>
<li> Regulations denotes the number of active EU regulations that impact on the import of goods from outside of EU</li>
<li> Measures denotes the number of individual ‘transactional’ measures that have been applied to importable goods</li>
<li> Goods impacted denotes the number of commodity codes impacted</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="measure-types">Measure types</h3><p><strong>Declaration of subheading submitted to authorised use provisions (464)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>These measures are applied whenever a differentiation is made in an anti-dumping case determination between the additional duties applicable for items destined for authorised use or standard use items. </li>
<li>For example, a definitive anti-dumping case may decide that the additional duty applies only when the importation purpose is not for authorised use. In cases such as this, an existing commodity code is split into two and the anti-dumping duty is applied to just one of the two.</li>
<li>This is illustrated in the case of regulation R0157/13 (&ldquo;imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of bioethanol originating in the United States of America&rdquo;) . As a result of this, commodity code &ldquo;2207100017&rdquo; (For other uses) was derived from the parent (already deeply branched) as distinct from commodity code &ldquo;2207100012&rdquo; (For use as fuel). </li>
<li>The anti-dumping duty (measure type 552) is placed on the non-authorised use code (&ldquo;For use as a fuel&rdquo;), whereas the code introduced for authorised use was assigned measure type 464 to indicate that an authorised use exemption was in place – no anti-dumping duty assigned to this commodity code.</li>
<li>These measures are for information purposes only: to end traders fill in their SAD forms and to provide &lsquo;clear&rsquo; instruction as to the circumstances that allow them to avoid anti-dumping duty.</li>
<li>According to the EU&rsquo;s TARIC user guide, this is &ldquo;to avoid a circumvention of the antidumping duties by declaring the wrong TARIC code&rdquo;.</li>
<li>There is no clear requirement for this measure type to be persisted in the UK.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Provisional anti-dumping duty (551)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The vast majority of these duties are assigned to a commodity with an additional code (to specify a specific company or a home company who is to be exempted of the duty) to assign an additional definitive punitive anti-dumping duty on a commodity.</li>
<li>This duty is applied on top of any existing tariffs (MFN or preferential) when import duty is calculated. Anti-dumping duties are raised when an overseas exporter is accused of &lsquo;dumping&rsquo; their goods on a foreign market and this is deemed to have an injurious effect on producers in that market. Anti-dumping cases go through multiple phases with the culmination of the case resulting in a definitive duty being applied.</li>
<li>Provisional duties are imposed when initial investigation (no less than 60 days from initiation of case) illustrates that the raised case is merited. From this point on, securities in the form of guarantees or bonds are required to be supplied by importers of such goods.</li>
<li>Compared to definitive antidumping duties, there are very few provisional anti-dumping duties on the current database. This is because they are typically converted to definitive measures once the case has been fully and forensically examined and appeals have been heard.</li>
<li>Alternatively, the measures could be dropped if found to be unsubstantiated.</li>
<li>Either way, the measures are designed to be short-lived, temporary checks until a definitive judgment is reached. The effect is to bring about protection for struggling domestic industries, if this is required in advance of a definitive judgement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Definitive anti-dumping duty (552)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>These duties are assigned to a commodity and in most cases an additional code (to specify a specific company against which a punitive measure is ranged or a home company who is to be exempted of the duty) to assign an additional definitive punitive anti-dumping duty on a commodity.</li>
<li>This duty is applied on top of any existing tariffs (MFN or preferential) when import duty is calculated. Anti-dumping duties are raised when an overseas exporter is accused of &lsquo;dumping&rsquo; their goods on a foreign market and this is deemed to have an injurious effect on producers in that market. Anti-dumping cases go through multiple phases with the culmination of the case resulting in a definitive duty being applied.</li>
<li>Even though fault has been found with the overseas exporter, the duty is payable by the UK importer. The additional duty acts as a deterrent against trading with the offending business and helps to protect the interests of UK manufacturers in the same market.</li>
<li>There are 158 records in the database where an offending or exempted company is not specified in the associated additional code, compared to 18,000 records in total (data from 2019).</li>
<li>Where an additional code is not provided, measures are usually set to Erga Omnes to avoid circumvention by ensuring certain goods have high duties when imported from any country.</li>
<li>The term ‘definitive’ will be re-badged as ‘final‘ in the UK tariff.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Provisional countervailing duty (553)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Countervailing duties, also known as anti-subsidy duties (the name that will apply in the UK tariff), differ from anti-dumping duties in that they determine that the illicit trading activity has been the result of state subsidy rather than purely the actions of an individual business / businesses.</li>
<li>The net effect of countervailing duties is however very much the same as with antidumping duties.</li>
<li>The provisional stage requires that traders supply securities on importing impacted goods rather than payment in full.</li>
<li>As of 30/06/19 there are no such measures on the database – this is a matter of timing rather than anything else, as all provisional measures have been converted to definitive equivalents.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Definitive countervailing duty (554)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Countervailing duties, also known as anti-subsidy duties (the name that will apply in the UK tariff), differ from anti-dumping duties in that they determine that the illicit trading activity has been the result of state subsidy rather than purely the actions of an individual business / businesses. The net effect of countervailing duties is however very much the same as with antidumping duties.</li>
<li>Countervailing duties are linked to companies, however a single regulation (R1519/15) caused an ERGA OMNES countervailing duty to be raised to cover imports from the rest of the world (with the exception of specific offenders USA, Canada, Argentina, Indonesia).</li>
<li>As with anti-dumping duties, definitive countervailing duties represent the culmination of an upheld investigation into a complaint of illicit activity with a net result that importers are liable for the full amount of countervailing duty, rather than the security that had been imposed in the prior provisional phase.</li>
<li>The term ‘definitive’ will be re-badged as ‘final‘ in the UK tariff.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anti-dumping / Countervailing duty - Pending collection (555)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>There are currently 96 measures of this type, derived from just 2 EU regulations (C0303/06 and D0223/14). The measures are linked to China, to which a definitive anti-dumping or countervailing duty has been assigned. Duty collection is suspended pending an examination into an exemption request.</li>
<li>In most cases, additional codes link to EU-based companies which have requested exemptions from the duties.</li>
<li>EU companies are implicated in a form of circumvention of anti-dumping or countervailing duty by bringing component parts into the home market and then constructing finished or more complete goods from component parts.</li>
<li>Therefore need specific exemptions to be able to import ‘dumped’ goods.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notice of initiation of an anti-dumping or countervailing proceeding (561)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>These are introduced when the controlling authority (for the UK this will be the TRA) is alerted to the fact that there is reason to investigate potential dumping or illegal state subsidy and conclude that the case warrants proper investigation.</li>
<li>When notices of initiation are first created, they have no end date against them: when the investigation reaches the point at which provisional duties are determined, the notice of initiation should be removed by setting the end date to the date of entry into force of the provisional duty measures.</li>
<li>Notices of initiation are ranged against commodity codes only and for the country that is accused in the initial applicant&rsquo;s case – not against additional codes at this stage as it is too early in the investigative process to determine any specific action against an individual company.</li>
<li>The measure is in any case not duty-bearing.</li>
<li>The net effect of the notice of initiation is statistical only – from this point all goods noted in the application will be surveilled in data captured via CDS and supplied back to the TRA for analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Suspended anti-dumping or countervailing duty (562)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>These measures are derived from a single regulation, which initiated a review into the import of photovoltaic cells from Malaysia into the EU. To illustrate the rarity of this measure, this exemption applies to just one business across 26 commodity codes.</li>
<li>In the regulation which engendered these measures, a notice of initiation of review of exemption, a single applicant (Longi (Kuching)), an exporter of cells from Malaysia, but parented in China is referenced. While this review is taking place, the duties against the claimant are suspended, pending further investigation of the claimant&rsquo;s case.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anti-dumping or countervailing registration (564)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Registration requests take place when a domestic producer is sufficiently concerned by the potential impact of an overseas manufacturer&rsquo;s activity that they request for all imports of commodity codes to be registered, which means that duty can be retroactively applied to any imports from the date of registration if the case is upheld through provisional and definitive measures. </li>
<li>In practice, registration is most frequently requested as a result of circumvention. Circumvention is any activity designed to avoid the payment of anti-dumping or countervailing duties imposed on a particular product manufactured in and/or exported from a non-EU country.</li>
<li>Registration takes place to put in place immediate measure to help to dissuade circumvention.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anti-dumping/countervailing review (565)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are multiple kinds of review that can be held with trade reviews. In most cases, the review type is an expiry review, which kicks in after the fourth year of an anti-dumping or countervailing case. However there are multiple reviews that can result in review-type measures being created.</p></li>
<li><p>The EU regulation that accompanies such a measure is entitled something like &ldquo; Notice of initiation of an expiry review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of certain aluminium radiators originating in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China&rdquo; – the measures are assigned against commodity codes, not against additional codes.</p></li>
<li><p>Each review is accompanied by a new piece of legislation (tertiary / public notice). This measure is for informational purposes only – there is no duty or operational impact of a review measure being created.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Changes to measure type description</strong></p>
<p>The following changes will be required for measure type descriptions related to Trade Remedies – essentially, any reference to “countervailing” will be replaced by a reference to “anti-subsidy’ and any reference to “definitive” will be replaced by “final”.</p>

      </div><p><strong>Additional duties (695)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Additional duties are imposed on imports of goods from overseas states in retaliation for trade activities that are seen to contravene WTO guidelines.</p></li>
<li><p>This may be as a result of a formal Trade Disputes case or as a safeguarding measure. There are very few measures of this kind of the EU database currently, however those that are present are all in response to behaviour from the USA, including the recent retaliation to President Trump&rsquo;s steel and aluminium tariffs in which 25% duties were raised against imports of those products from the EU, Mexico and Canada. The EU exacted revenge by imposing 25% duties on multiple US-sourced products including Harley Davidson (and other) motorcycles from the USA etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Duties are also applied against imports of other US-sourced goods such as sweetcorn (maize), corrective glasses, denim and cranes</p></li>
<li><p>Additional duties are imposed on top of any other applicable duties, much in the way that anti-dumping and countervailing duties are added to the more standard duties.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At a glance:</p>

<ul>
<li>Additional duties in form of ‘safe guards’</li>
<li>Applied in retaliation to trade activities that are seen as not complying with WTO guidelines</li>
<li>Additional charge on top of standard duty</li>
