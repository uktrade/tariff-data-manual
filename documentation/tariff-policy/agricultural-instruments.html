<h3 id="introduction-to-agricultural-instruments">Introduction to agricultural instruments</h3><p>There are 5 types of agricultural measure that you will need to be aware of, albeit not all are likely to be active in the UK tariff on day one. These are:
* The Meursing table and Meursing codes
* Unit prices or Simplified Procedural Values (SPVs)
* The Entry Price System &amp; Standard Import Values
* Representative prices for chicken
* Variable prices for cereals and rice</p>
<h3 id="the-meursing-table-and-meursing-codes">The Meursing table and Meursing codes</h3><p><strong>About Meursing codes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Meursing codes are used in the EU to apply specific duties to compound agri-goods (the official term for delicious cakes and biscuits), depending on the relative content of sugar, flour and milk starch / solids.</li>
<li>Meursing codes were introduced to allow for cakes etc. to be taxed according to their ‘luxury’ value without there needing to be literally thousands of new commodity codes to be created to cater for the many permutations.</li>
<li>The EU has executed the revenue collection for such goods using Meursing additional codes.</li>
<li>For the best detailed view of Meursing codes, please see this blog by trade expert Peter Ungphakorn.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Meursing table</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The trader works out the constituent parts of sugar, butter etc, looks for the correct cell in the table to the right for their product’s recipe.</li>
<li>The then declares this number, prefaced by the Meursing identifier “7”, on their import declaration form, after which the duty is calculated in the border system.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How do Meursing codes impact duty calculations?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>In UK parlance, the component parts are displayed using the three terms:

<ul>
<li>AC – standing for “Agricultural Component”, means milk-based product (like butter)</li>
<li>SD – standing for “Sugar Duty”</li>
<li>FD – standing for “Flour Duty”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the EU jurisdiction, these were respectively referred to as EA, ADSZ and ADFM, which are the French and German equivalents of AC, SD and FD (Elément agricole, Additional duties – Sucre Zucker, Additional duties – Farine, Mehl).</li>
<li>If a duty is displayed as 7.60% + EA (see product 1901200000 - right), this means that there is a simple ad valorem duty of 7.60% plus a variable component based on milk / butter content.</li>
<li>The trader can then look up the milk / butter content’s Meursing code, either by looking at the table, or by using the UK gov online service, and then work out the full duty.</li>
<li>Actually the EU’s Taric consultation is the best (until the end of the Implementation period), as the Meursing tool is semi-integrated into the standard tariff lookup.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94800799-01ee9200-03dd-11eb-991f-4c99e123c02d.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94800799-01ee9200-03dd-11eb-991f-4c99e123c02d.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<p>Showing 3rd country (MFN) duty for  product 1901200000 (Malt extract) on the Trade Tariff Service</p>
<p>The duty is not just a simple ad valorem or a specific duty based on a weight (or other unit). Instead, the import duties will depend on the %age content of milk protein &amp; milk fat.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/commodities/1901200000">https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/commodities/1901200000</a></p>
<p><strong>Meursing additional codes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Meursing placeholders are ‘replaced’ by additional codes of a specific type (type 7)</li>
<li>Type 7 codes are stored in a different table from all other additional codes: it is not clear why</li>
<li>Duties are assigned to the Meursing additional codes, not the commodities that might use them in their measures.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94800960-424e1000-03dd-11eb-9f50-78b840ad1669.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94800960-424e1000-03dd-11eb-9f50-78b840ad1669.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<p><strong>How the EU Taric Consultation facilitates Meursing</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>On the EU Taric Consultation site, which will be of no relevance to us after the end of the Implementation Period, the Meursing functionality is embedded into the standard tariff lookup function.</li>
<li>Again, with example product 1901200000, the trader first sees  the duty 7.60% + EA(1) - picture 1</li>
<li>Then the trader either enters the %age components into a tool like the UK’s Meursing tool, or they enter the relevant 3 digit code from the Meursing table.</li>
<li>This then refreshes the page (picture 2) with an expanded duty. The specific duty of 117.85 EUR/100kg has been inserted to replace the “EA” placeholder</li>
<li>BTW – the (1) in brackets refers to something called the reduction indicator – see later</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94801643-3d3d9080-03de-11eb-9603-d7bd35687c24.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94801643-3d3d9080-03de-11eb-9603-d7bd35687c24.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<h3 id="the-future-or-meursings-mixed">The future or Meursings … mixed</h3><p>This is an extremely complex process for traders, and almost impossible to marshal for Border Force, therefore the UK had taken the decision to abandon the Meursing system for No Deal – this may be reversed for the end of the Implementation period.</p>
<p>Caveat 1 - While having no Meursing codes helps to simplify the UK tariff, it is only a partial saving grace, as there remains a requirement to include Meursing-related information in the reference document.</p>
<p>This is hugely problematic, as it defeats the point of using the actual UK tariff as the source for the reference document: the Meursing data needs to come from elsewhere – in this case from the live EU database. Perversely, if Meursings were to return, this would simplify document production.</p>
<p>Caveat 2 – anything stated now may not be true by the end of the Implementation period.</p>
<p>A recent Cabinet paper has identified that there will be a review of all agricultural instruments.</p>
<p>Some interest has been shown in a simplification of the Meursing table, e.g. reducing the columns and rows to more manageable &amp; intelligible options, but is unlikely to have been agreed before Jan 2021.</p>
<p>Caveat 3 – the Northern Ireland Protocol means that NI traders in goods considered at risk will be subject to the full Union Customs Code (UCC), including the full set of applicable EU import duties.</p>
<p>Whether this is deliverable by 2021 is in doubt.But the UCC includes Meursing, therefore some UK traders, and DDaT and DIT Policy team will need to understand this subject in depth.It is not going away.</p>
<p><strong>Setting measures against Meursing codes</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Meursing codes break the mould in nearly every way. Everything you have learnt about the tariff, relearn it for Meursing codes.</li>
<li>First, these are the sole instances in the tariff of duties (measures and measure components) being assigned against an additional code alone, and not against a combination of commodity code and additional code.</li>
<li>The Image top right shows the absence of commodity code (goods_nomenclature_item_id) but presence of the Meursing additional code (7012)</li>
<li>The measure type of 674 indicates that this duty, once calculated with the specific ingredient percentages, will insert a duty to replace an EA (agricultural component) placeholder.</li>
<li>The duties assigned to this measure are highlighted in the image right bottom.</li>
<li>Read more about this in the measure components guide, which explains what all these fields mean in detail.</li>
<li>Basically this means “add a duty equal to 17.18 Euros per 100kg (1 decitonne)” to any measure that includes an EA placeholder, regardless of the commodity code.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94802223-29465e80-03df-11eb-8552-4587846a6b7d.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94802223-29465e80-03df-11eb-8552-4587846a6b7d.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Calculating Meursing duties on complex duties</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Let’s take this as an example – this is commodity code 1704905500 Throat pastilles and cough drops with a screen grab taken from the Trade Tariff Service.</li>
<li>Yes, we apply duties based on sugar and butter content on throat lozenges, imported from the Faroe Islands.</li>
<li>The trader sees the duty  0.00 % + EA MAX 18.70 % +ADSZ</li>
<li>This reads (in English) as:</li>
<li>0.00% ad valorem (a reduction from the 9.00% of the MFN)</li>
<li>Plus the agricultural component supplement</li>
<li>Up to a maximum of 18.70% ad valorem …</li>
<li>Plus the sugar component</li>
<li>At this point the trader does not know the values that will replace EA and ADSZ, so they look up their ingredient %ages and come up with a Meursing additional code 7507.</li>
<li>The trader sends comm code 1704905500 and additional code 7507 to CDS / CHIEF and they replace the EA &amp; ADSZ placeholders with real specific duties (which they all are).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94802706-0ec0b500-03e0-11eb-8dcf-475bc2f108ff.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94802706-0ec0b500-03e0-11eb-8dcf-475bc2f108ff.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<p>Hence, 0.00% + EA up to a MAX of 18.70% +ADSZ</p>
<p>becomes</p>
<p>0.00% + 18.87 €/100kg up to a MAX of 18.70% + 99.88 €/100kg</p>
<p>when the recipe is added. To reiterate: Meursing duties are applicable to the recipe, not the commodity; but they are only chargeable when replacing the placeholders in comm code duties.</p>
<p><strong>Meursing measure types &amp; duty expressions</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94803190-db325a80-03e0-11eb-8f36-5691b75a6ef9.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94803190-db325a80-03e0-11eb-8f36-5691b75a6ef9.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The reduction indicator and geographical areas</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Meursing code measures are typically assigned to the geographical area ID 1011 (Erga Omnes, the whole world).</li>
<li>However, they can be assigned to other countries: in fact the following countries / groups have Meursing measures, allowing the EU to tailor duties to the individual countries:</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94803778-bd192a00-03e1-11eb-8ab4-5fbee2a9ff40.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94803778-bd192a00-03e1-11eb-8ab4-5fbee2a9ff40.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li>So geographical areas add a further dimension to the management of Meursing-related duties.</li>
<li>Just when you thought it could not get any more complex, along comes the reduction indicator.</li>
<li>The table on the previous page showed a pair of duty expressions that can be related to a Meursing-type measure</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94803603-70cdea00-03e1-11eb-94ce-0ff873c37674.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94803603-70cdea00-03e1-11eb-94ce-0ff873c37674.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li>The second of these pairs (reduced additional duty on sugar / flour / agricultural component) allows the EU to assign effectively a different Meursing table</li>
<li>The reduction indicator can only be applied to preferential duties – i.e. it is never assigned to Erga Omnes (1011).</li>

<li>The table to the left shows the following, for Meursing duties in the Singapore trade agreement, which has 2 reduction indicators and all three ingredient axes:

<ul>
<li>column 1 – measure type, concatenated with additional code (would reach all the way down to 996 with the same results)</li>
<li>column 2 – duties applicable that ‘recipe’ for the given axis (AC, SD or FD) under reduction indicator 1 (full duty, no reduction)</li>
<li>column 3 – duties applicable that ‘recipe’ for the given axis (AC, SD or FD) under reduction indicator 2 (preferential reduction on Meursing duties applies)</li>
<li>column 4 – shows that reduction indicator 2 brings in a duty that is 90% of the non-reduced version, across every permutation of measure type and ingredient axis, albeit there is a small error for rounding (specific tariffs are not usually captured in the tariff to more than 2 decimal places).</li>
<li>column 5 – rounds column 4 to one decimal place</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The result is the same for all 1,512 rows (3 axes * 504 cells).</li>
<li>And the principle applies for every trade agreement, though the %ages will vary according to what has been agreed</li>

<ul>
<li>Japan’s FTA has these 6 reduction indicators that allow for differential %age to be reduced against different commodity codes.</li>
<li>The reductions are not sequential – i.e. the rates fluctuate in size.</li>
<li>And there look to be errors in it – highlighted in yellow. It’s not clear why these values do not match the rubric.</li>
<li>And the final bizarre thing: there are only 16 products that have Meursing duty expression, but more than 3,000 unique duties are set up.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Meursing tables – data structure</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94836258-b18e2900-040a-11eb-89be-144dcb3d99c3.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94836258-b18e2900-040a-11eb-89be-144dcb3d99c3.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<p>Meursing appears to have been tacked on to the basic tariff, as a lot of the principles that apply across the board otherwise have been abandoned.
Most importantly, although they are treated as additional codes in assigning measures, they are stored in separate tables from all other such codes (and transmitted to HMRC as such).
The standard “type 1” naming convention &amp; data structure has also been eschewed: 
meursing_subgheadings contains the descriptions
meursing_heading_texts is used instead of the more standard meursing_heading_descriptioins</p>
<h3 id="unit-prices-spvs">Unit prices (SPVs)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unit price is a synonym for Simplified Procedural Value (SPV).</li>
<li>It is used for goods that are imported on consignment, i.e. they are yet to be sold, so they need a reference price to work out import duty and VAT.</li>
<li>The UK typically uses the term SPV, the EU typically uses the term Unit Price, but they are interchangeable.</li>
<li>Traders can only use the SPV scheme for whole fruit and vegetable produce, of a single kind, imported on a consignment basis.</li>
<li>SPVs are customs values derived from prices at which goods were sold on sales in specified markets within Europe. The prices gathered from across the EU are combined (through a process that is not understood in DIT) to form a single “Unit price”</li>
<li>Unit prices are used on certain fruit and vegetables only (54 commodity codes at the time of writing)</li>
<li>Excluded from the scheme are fruit or vegetable products that have undergone a cut and dicing process prior to importation.</li>
<li>SPVs are updated by the EU fortnightly, starting midnight Thursday / Friday, while the UK still needs to work out the frequency with which we will update these values.</li>
<li>For SPVs (and SIVs) the unit of measure is always DTN (100kg or decitonne).</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of commodity codes that are assigned Unit Prices are: garlic, cauliflowers, asparagus, carrots, peas, aubergine, celery, sweet peppers, beans as well as soft fruit such as plums, peaches, nectarines, strawberries etc.</p>
<p><strong>Future of the SPV &amp; currency usage</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The SPV is expected to be widely used in the UK Tariff post-implementation period, as the requirement to divine a price for goods delivered on consignment will persist.</li>
<li>Work will be required to understand how often the SPVs are to be updated (every 2 weeks in the EU).</li>
<li>SPV are and will remain without exception aimed at Erga Omnes (1011 – the whole world) – there are no preferential instances of SPVs.</li>
<li>SPVs use measure type 488 (Unit Price)</li>
<li>There are never any conditions associated with an SPV, just components identifying the specific import duty (e.g. 184.58 EUR (EUC) / 100 kg)</li>
<li>It is not clear why the EU uses the monetary unit EUC instead of just EUR. EUC stands for “Euro, according to Article 146 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 2015/2447”. This document is the EU legislation underpinning the UCC (Union Customs Code), and hints at the reason (right - i.e. usage of monthly conversion factor).</li>
<li>There remain outstanding questions on the future of currency in the management of import duties: EUROs will remain for the time being but may be replaced by sterling at some stage in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>CHAPTER 3 - Currency conversion 
Article 48 - Provisions on tariff exchange rate (Article 53 of the Code) 
1. The value of the euro, where required in accordance with Article 53(1)(b) of the Code, shall be fixed once a month. </p>
<p>The exchange rate to be used shall be the most recent rate set by the European Central Bank prior to the penultimate day of the month and shall apply throughout the following month. 
However, where the rate applicable at the start of the month differs by more than 5 % from the rate set by the European Central Bank prior to the 15th of that same month, the latter rate shall apply from the 15th until the end of the month in question.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Where the conversion of currency is necessary for any of the reasons referred to in Article 53(2) of the Code, the value of the euro in national currencies to be applied shall be the rate set by the European Central Bank on the first working day of October; this rate shall apply with effect from 1 January of the following year.</p></li>
<li><p>Member States may maintain unchanged the value in national currency of the amount determined in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment, the conversion of that amount, leads to an alteration of less than 5 % in the value expressed in national currency. 
Member States may round upwards or downwards to the nearest decimal point the sum arrived at after conversion </p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-entry-price-system-amp-sivs">The Entry Price System &amp; SIVs</h3>
<ul>
<li>The EU protects growers of 15 kinds of selected fruits and vegetables against international competition not only by the means of ad valorem tariffs of up to 20%, but also by the EPS.</li>
<li>The EPS came into effect on 1 July 1995</li>
<li>Analogous to a minimum import price, the EPS is designed to restrict imports below the product-specific, politically designated EP plus ad valorem tariff.</li>
<li>If the EP is undercut, an additional specific tariff is levied, which proportionally varies depending on the gap between the product’s actual import price and the EP.</li>
<li>When the EP is undercut by 8% or more, the maximum specific tariff, referred to as the maximum tariff equivalent (MTE), of up to 80% of the EP is charged.</li>
<li>For example, the EPS is applied to oranges during the EU orange harvest season in the time period December 1 to May 31.</li>
<li>The MFN tariff for oranges seasonally varies between 3.2% and 16.0% whereas the MFN EP remains constant at a level of 354 €/t.</li>
<li>If oranges are exported to the EU at a price of 336.3 €/t, the EP is undercut by 5%.</li>
<li>This implies that the exporter has to pay an additional specific tariff of 17.7 €/t which is equal to the gap between the import price and the EP.</li>
<li>If the entry price for oranges is undercut by 8% or more, an additional specific tariff at the level of the MTE of 71 €/t is charged.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standard Import Values (SIVs)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Monitoring compliance with the EPS faces the difficulty that a large share of fruit and vegetable imports in the EU is on commission, implying that the import price is not determined until the product is sold in the EU market.</li>
<li>Therefore, the European Commission calculates a synthetic import price, the standard import value (SIV).</li>
<li>Fruit and vegetable prices, surveyed for each product and export country individually, are collected on representative fruit and vegetable wholesale markets in all EU Member States (for example New Covent Garden Market in the UK).</li>
<li>The daily SIVs are calculated as a weighted average of collected wholesale market prices, less a marketing and transportation margin and applied tariffs.</li>
<li>DIT has not been made aware of the specific calculations that will be undertaken to manage the SIV, as this is a Defra responsibility</li>
<li>It is also not 100% clear as to what the future of the SIV in the UK will be, not for that matter the Entry Price System as a whole.</li>
<li>The EPS was designed as a protectionist measure for EU growers – during growing season they had to sell their goods or see them rot: outside that season, the EPS is not applied. The UK does not have the same climate, nor therefore the same agricultural sensibilities.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94836888-6a546800-040b-11eb-9ff8-8aaf85abef29.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94836888-6a546800-040b-11eb-9ff8-8aaf85abef29.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Therefore the expectation is that the EPS will be abandoned in the UK (needs to be validated, and may well change through the Transition Period).</li>
<li>However, the SIV must stay for tax calculation and reporting purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The SIV without the Entry Price System</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>If there is no Entry Price System, then the SIV will need to persist regardless. This is because it offers traders a way of valuing their goods for import duty and VAT calculation perspective.</li>
<li>Let’s say a consignment of sweet oranges arrives from overseas to be sold on New Covent Garden Market. At the point of arrival into the UK, it does not have a sale price.</li>
<li>And yet, there will possibly be a desire to impose some kind of import duty (dependent on trade policy) and there will also be a desire to calculate a VAT surcharge.</li>
<li>In actual fact, VAT on such goods in the UK is 0% and the likelihood of the UK imposing import duties on goods we do not grow in the UK (to industrial volumes) is small, therefore the taxation &amp; revenue aspect of the SIV is apparently negligible.</li>
<li>However, the VAT calculation still needs to know the ‘value’ of the goods to do its 0% calculation, therefore some yardstick (the SIV) is required.</li>
<li>Moreover for reporting purposes, the SIV allows statistical analysis of the value of imports to be carried out: without a nominal value this would not be possible.</li>
<li>One could argue that, without the Entry Price System, the SIV is precisely the same as the SPV (Unit Price), as the purpose, mechanic and impact would be identical.</li>
<li>However they are legislated for separately and the UK is reserving the right to bring back the EPS, therefore the distinction is likely to remain.</li>
<li>Defra need to be consulted on this, as it is a changing area</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The relationship of SIVs to SPV</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>There are 7 commodity codes (data from 2019), where both SIVs and SPVs apply (below).</li>
<li>The two pivot tables to the right show the usage of SPVs and SIVs throughout a year on commodity code 0805102200 (Sweet oranges).</li>
<li>The tables show that the SIV applies while the EPS is running (in the EU) and the SPV applies when it does not, according to European growing (marketing) seasons. SPV and SIV are never concurrent on the same commodity code.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94838284-3ed27d00-040d-11eb-8e29-feeb7834b4a8.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94838284-3ed27d00-040d-11eb-8e29-feeb7834b4a8.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<p><strong>SIVs and key origins</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Entry Price Systems is not one-size fits all. There are multiple countries which have specific SIVs that differ from the SIV applied to MFNs (this is never the case with SPVs).</li>
<li>For example, on the commodity to the right (Monreales – 0805220011 [a type of clementine]), there are multiple geography-specific SIV rates, as per the image to the right, showing the applicable measures for Israel (which has its own SIV for monreales), compares to the SIV for Erga Omnes (bottom right).</li>
<li>This is a reflection of the prices of goods when they are gathered in the EU markets on a per origin basis.</li>
<li>The following slide shows the countries which have their own SIV values (2019 Jan 1st onwards).</li>
<li>Erga Omnes (1011) has full coverage, while other nations’ SIVs are very specific, e.g. for Australia, the EU has SIVs solely for apples</li>
</ul>

<p>*<em>The Entry Price System in Action *</em></p>

<ul>
<li>The screen grab to the right shows a fragment of the page on the Trade Tariff Service for the import of Cider apples (0808108010).</li>
<li>There are two rows that are interesting. First, the SIV itself for Erga Omnes</li>
<li>Secondly, the third country duty – in most cases, a third country duty is not conditional: it is applicable to all trades in goods from non-preferential zones.</li>
<li>On goods where the EPS applies, the third country duty is dependent on the import price, which, if the good is brought in on consignment, may be determined by the SIV.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94839126-7db50280-040e-11eb-9531-2dcc642ec60d.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94839126-7db50280-040e-11eb-9531-2dcc642ec60d.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Clicking on “Conditions” shows the condition mechanic – this is described in more detail in the guide on measure conditions, but the meaning of this page is as per the preamble on the workings of the EPS.</li>
<li>The applicable duties for the import of a good are inversely proportional to the declared import price – i.e. the lower the import price, the higher the duties, according to pre-set thresholds.</li>
<li>The duty is expressed in terms of a flat ad valorem and a specific: typically it is just the specific duty which changes, though here, if the good is imported at a very low price, then the duties are waived entirely.</li>
<li>The system is tightly balanced, showing the precarious nature of Southern European agri-business, with the thresholds being respectively 98, 96, 92, 90, 88 and 86% of the zero-duty reference price.</li>

<h3 id="representative-prices-for-poultry">Representative prices for poultry</h3>
<ul>
<li>Representative Prices for Poultry are a type of special agricultural safeguard, protecting the domestic market from influx of cheap imports of poultry products at high volume.</li>
<li>The world chicken market is highly competitive and there are certain countries which would be able to gain a complete hegemony in poultry trade if safeguards were not applied. In the world of poultry, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Thailand are far and away the biggest exporters and therefore these safeguard measures are applied solely to their exports.</li>
<li>Representative prices differ for different origins. While these have been calculated by DG Agri in the European Commission, and the UK has been able to vote on the representative prices, we nor other individual member states are involved in the calculation, nor understand how they are calculated.</li>
<li>Representative prices an be raised at any time and the prices and trigger tiers are modified regularly (once a month for chicken products).</li>
<li>There are also representative price measures for molasses, but this function has been dormant for a number of years, therefore does not need to be considered for the UK tariff.</li>
</ul>
<p>*<em>How Representative Prices work *</em></p>

<ul>
<li>The concept behind representative prices for poultry is very similar to the Entry Price System for Fruit and Vegetables, however there are a number of additional operational challenges that traders face in importing goods against this regime.</li>
<li>To the right is a view of the measures that are associated with the import of boneless chicken cuts (0207141000) from Argentina.</li>
<li>All 5 of these measures contribute to the duties and securities that will be required of a chicken importer.</li>
<li>Under a No Deal, this trade safeguard would have been abandoned in the UK, but it is potentially back on the table.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94839406-ddaba900-040e-11eb-8685-2cf94040742a.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94839406-ddaba900-040e-11eb-8685-2cf94040742a.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first measure to be looked at is the representative price measure itself (measure type 489).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94839511-0338b280-040f-11eb-806a-9a65b155bb5e.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94839511-0338b280-040f-11eb-806a-9a65b155bb5e.png" alt="image" /></a></p></li>
<li><p>This is similar in purpose to the Standard Import Value measure (490) used for fruit &amp; veg – it sets an expected acceptable import price for a good.</p></li>
<li><p>As per the regulation covering this, which is refreshed on a regular basis in the EU:</p></li>
<li><p>The representative prices […] shall be determined at regular intervals (monthly) taking into account in particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>the prices on third country markets</li>
<li>free-at-Community-frontier offer prices</li>
<li>prices at the various stages of marketing in the Community for imported products.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The importer may choose to use the “representative price” method to calculate import duty on their goods.</p></li>
<li><p>Or, at the request of the importer, the additional duty may be established on the basis of the CIF import price of the consignment in question, if this price is higher than the applicable representative price.</p></li>
<li><p>The application of the CIF (cost, insurance &amp; freight) import price of the consignment for establishing the additional duty is subject to the presentation of multiple documents including the purchasing contract (to prove value).</p></li>
<li><p>The importer must lodge a security (deposit)  equal to the amount of additional duty which he would have paid if the calculation of the additional duty had been made on the basis of the representative price applicable to the product in question.</p></li>
<li><p>So here is the second of the five measures explained (measure type 653):</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94839476-f61bc380-040e-11eb-826b-cce16308f908.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94839476-f61bc380-040e-11eb-826b-cce16308f908.png" alt="image" /></a></p></li>
<li><p>Essentially, border authorities do not trust that the goods being brought in are going to be sold at the value documented on the purchasing contract: securities are lodged until the importer can prove that they are not lying.</p></li>
<li><p>The importer has one month from the sale of the products in question to prove that the consignment was disposed of at the stated price.</p></li>
<li><p>Failure to meet the deadline means they lose the security lodged. But if they can prove sale conditions matched those declared, then securities are returned.</p></li>
</ul>

<ins>How to calculate applicable duties</ins>

<ul>
<li>If the difference between the (representative) trigger price and the import price:</li>
<li> is less than or equal to 10 % of the trigger price, no additional duty shall be imposed;</li>
<li> is greater than 10 % but less than or equal to 40 % of the trigger price, the additional duty shall equal 30 % of the amount by which the difference exceeds 10 %;</li>
<li>is greater than 40 % but less than or equal to 60 % of the trigger price, the additional duty shall equal 50 % of the amount by which the difference exceeds 40 %, plus the additional duty allowed under (b);</li>
<li>is greater than 60 % but less than or equal to 75 %, the additional duty shall equal 70 % of the amount by which the difference exceeds 60 % of the trigger price, plus the additional duties allowed under (b) and &copy;;</li>
<li>is greater than 75 % of the trigger price, the additional duty shall equal 90 % of the amount by which the difference exceeds 75 %, plus the additional duties allowed under (b), &copy; and (d).</li>
<li>So here is the third measure that is applied – measure type 652, Additional duty based on cif price.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94840011-b1dcf300-040f-11eb-9071-a7d1254d2f17.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94840011-b1dcf300-040f-11eb-9071-a7d1254d2f17.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<p>We actually do not need to worry too much about this calculation, but at least it helps to clarify the stepped thresholds applied on such conditional measures.</p>

<ins>Duty calculation using measure conditions</ins>
<p>The five thresholds that were noted on the previous page (derived from the controlling EU regulation) are represented by measure conditions with price thresholds.
The mechanisms are almost identical to the Entry Price’s thresholds (which use condition code V). These use condition code L, which essentially references the CIF price instead.
Duties are then applied in inverse relation to the declared import price.</p>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94840369-37f93980-0410-11eb-917d-4a6415d264e4.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94840369-37f93980-0410-11eb-917d-4a6415d264e4.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Reducing representative prices under quota</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The final two measures allow a trade in poultry under representative prices to be reduced by way of a quota – or, in this case, two licensed quotas for the import of poultry products.</li>
<li>This sets a further threshold whereby the representative price and associated securities do not kick in until the quota is exhausted / licences allocated and used.</li>
<li>These quotas behave much in the way of existing quotas, but do use specialised measure types (653 and 654)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94840452-5b23e900-0410-11eb-874d-9ec179535a39.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94840452-5b23e900-0410-11eb-874d-9ec179535a39.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Prognosis for representative prices</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Under No Deal, representative prices for chicken would have been dumped as a trade instrument. However, as a consultation is now going out to ask traders what they think of the EU tariff, all best are off.</li>
<li>The UK may be required to support this function, hence the detailed explanation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="variable-duties-for-rice-and-cereals">Variable duties for rice and cereals</h3>
<ins>Situation in the EU</ins>
<p>The types of cereals covered by this system are: durum wheat, high quality common wheat, rye, maize, sorghum.
The duty to be applied will be the difference between an EU reference price of €157.03/tonne (155% of the EU intervention price) and the cost of delivering the consignment in question to an EU port (including cost, insurance and freight). However, that duty may not exceed the WTO bound rate of duty set out in the Common Customs Tariff. 
The Commission carry out a daily calculation, though the rate fixes if not changed significantly against mean for 10 days.</p>

<ins>UK prognosis</ins>
<p>It is likely that the UK will not vary duties on cereals, but will retain the legal capability.</p>
<p><strong>Import duties set by route into the Union</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The screen grab to the right shows commodity code 1007900000 (Grain sorghum – a type of millet)</li>
<li>You can see that there are 3 additional codes assigned to the commodity code that must be used by traders in these goods to identify the route taken to get the goods into the Union.</li>
<li>You can also see that the duties are all 0.00%, meaning that the differentiation is of little value.</li>
<li>In fact, variable duties for cereals exists in name &amp; (dormant) legislative power only – the EU has not operationalised these powers for some time, and the UK has (at the last count) no intention of operationalising it.</li>
<li>As always with agri measures, please keep close to the situation in case it changes. We are likely to legislate for this, but not use it in anger.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94840713-c53c8e00-0410-11eb-84c1-189fd53595c6.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/94840713-c53c8e00-0410-11eb-84c1-189fd53595c6.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Variable duty for rice</strong></p>

<ins>Situation in the EU</ins>
<p>Currently includes Husked (brown) rice (excluding husked basmati rice), Semi-milled/milled (white) rice.
Import duties for husked and semi-milled/milled rice are fixed on the basis of the level of import licences issued in the preceding 12 and 6 month period respectively.
Rice Marketing year runs from 1 September – 31 August
This is executed in the tariff as a standard Third country tariff.</p>

<ins>Prognosis for the UK</ins>
<p>As with ‘variable’ duties for cereals, this simply does not change frequently: in addition, as this solely uses simple third country duties (type 103), there is no special mechanism for DDaT or tariff managers to be concerned with.</p>
