            <h1 id="geographical-areas">Geographical areas</h1><h3 id="introduction-to-geographical-areas">Introduction to geographical areas</h3>
<ul>
<li>All measures must be assigned to a single geographical area entity.</li>
<li>This entity, derived from the geographical_areas view may itself be:

<ul>
<li>a single country (like Namibia)</li>
<li>a group of countries (like Cariforum [a Caribbean trading bloc])</li>
<li>a region – which is a slight misnomer, meaning as it does a country that has yet to be 
fully incorporated, like Kosovo, which remains partially recognised.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A quota though may be assigned to multiple geographical area entities. While this is the case in the EU, the UK is trying to abandon this, for example there is a wine quota (09.1530) in use for the West Balkan countries1 that is going to be split into 6 individual quotas post-implementation period.</li>
<li>A geographical area that is defined as being a country group will have one or more countries (or regions) designated as members of that country group.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="identifying-geographical-areas">Identifying geographical areas</h3>
<ul>
<li>An identifier for a country group (geographical_area_id) is structured depending on the type of area in question.</li>
<li>The geographical code field dictates what type of geographical area is involved:

<ul>
<li>0 Country</li>
<li>1 Country group</li>
<li>2 Region</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For all countries and regions, the code is a 2-digit upper-case alphabetical string

<ul>
<li>For countries, this is based on the international standard (ISO_3166-1) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)</li>
<li>For regions, i.e. unincorporated states, the code is typically a 2-digit string beginning with X, followed by the first letter of the country. e.g. as an upshot of the splintering of the former Yugoslavia, Serbia and Kosovo were formed as ‘regions’, not countries: Serbia = XS, Kosovo = XK. Even though Serbia is now a fully recognised sovereign state, it remains a region (practical implications of flipping; Kosovo is still officially considered to be a part of Serbia by over half the world).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For country groups, the code is an alpha-numeric string of 4-digits.

<ul>
<li>For country groups set up by the EU, these 4-digit strings are always numeric, e.g. 1001 = Erga Omnes (whole world)</li>
<li>For nationally setup groups (historically managed by HMRC), the groups are alpha-numeric, for example F006 (Phytosanitary certificates)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="about-country-groups">About country groups</h3><p>The last example on the previous page (F006 Phytosanitary certificates) shows that the country groups do not have to align to an enshrined globally understood trading entity like EU (1011), CARIFORUM (1033) or GSP LDC (2005).</p>
<p>Because the meat and drink of Taric and TAP is to produce measures, which can be connected to just one single geographical area, it is often simpler just to create a group of countries and apply the measure to the group and not the individual countries.</p>
<p>This can often be at the expense of making total sense however. For example, to execute the regulations associated with handloomed products, a group has been set up to accommodate the countries to which a quota applies for such products – the name of the group is “Silk or cotton handloom products”.</p>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92506166-eee10b80-f1fc-11ea-9d9a-ef1157fad306.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92506166-eee10b80-f1fc-11ea-9d9a-ef1157fad306.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h2 id="geographical-area-membership">Geographical area membership</h2><p>Geographical areas that represent country groups (area code 1) are designed to include member countries</p>
<p>A geographical area group can only contain regions or countries (area codes 0 and 2), not other geographical area groups – any attempt to assign a country group to another country group as a member must not be permitted and cause a business rule failure at HMRC. A geographical area’s membership of a country group is bookended by a start date and potentially and end date, where absolutely required.</p>
<p>While geographical areas are absolutely not a volatile area within the application, and the changes are few and far between, there are a number of use cases where membership does change, albeit infrequently. For example, countries move in and out of GSP tiers from year to year as their progress or decline economically.</p>
<p>Steel safeguards work on country groups created specifically for the purpose of applying punitive duties against large numbers of countries; these groups tend to change from year to year, as we learn more about the impact of the punitive duties on trade flows.</p>
<p>The UK may choose to create country groups to apply specific regulatory controls.</p>
<h3 id="relationship-of-measures-to-geographical-areas">Relationship of measures to geographical areas</h3>
<ul>
<li>All measures are assigned to precisely one geographical area.</li>
<li>That area may be a country, region (non-incorporated country) or a group of countries.</li>
<li>If the geographical area is a country group, then it is possible to exclude (one or more) members of that country group from the measure via inclusion in the measure_excluded_geographical_areas table.</li>
<li>The excluded country must be a member of that group.</li>
<li>Please note: both the excluded_geographical_area and geographical_area_id fields refer to the excluded country, not the group.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="relationship-of-quotas-to-geographical-areas">Relationship of quotas to geographical areas</h3>
<ul>
<li>All quotas need to be represented both as measures and within the structures related to quotas.</li>
<li>With licensed quotas, these are only represented by quotas.</li>
<li>The relationship of geographical areas to quotas needs to be reflected in both the measures and quotas structures (except for licensed quotas).</li>
<li>Therefore both the relationship of quotas to their origins and measures to the related geographical areas needs to be managed and synchronised in the data creation.</li>
</ul>
