<blockquote>
<p>Measures are the fundamental building blocks of the tariff, they link everything together, and each piece of trade legislation that impacts the trade of goods must be translated into one or more measures.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="introduction-to-measures">Introduction to measures</h2><p>A measure is the fundamental raison d’être of the tariff – every piece of trade legislation that is intended to impact the trade of goods through a country’s borders must end up in a measure (or usually more than one).</p>
<p>If there is no measure, then the border systems will not react.</p>
<p>A measure is an atomic unit: according to the Tariff, it is “the application, during a certain period, of an aspect of the Union tariff and commercial legislation to goods imported from a certain origin or exported to a certain destination” which sums it up quite nicely.</p>
<p>A measure equates to a single line on the “Trade with the UK tool” - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-rules-tariffs-trade-with-uk">https://www.gov.uk/get-rules-tariffs-trade-with-uk</a></p>
<p>A measure equates to a single line on the Trade Tariff Service (UKTT) - <a href="https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/sections">https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/sections</a></p>
<p>Below is a page from the UKTT for Asses (the animal) – each alternating grey &amp; white line is a single measure. Some commodity codes can have hundreds of measures assigned to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92616091-bbae8300-f2b5-11ea-8997-8fe2a54ffee7.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92616091-bbae8300-f2b5-11ea-8997-8fe2a54ffee7.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h2 id="what-a-measure-is-not">What a measure is not!</h2><p>The tariff is a sea of intermingled terminologies – terms are used in different senses by different policy areas.</p>
<p>For instance, in Trade Remedies, the term ‘measure’ may be synonymous with ‘case’, e.g. an investigation launched by the TRA against multiple companies/countries. In this case, the ‘case’ will of followed through to its conclusion, result in a number of measures, a Tariff would refer to them – in the case of Trade Remedies, this could result in many thousands of Tariff measures.</p>
<p>A measure is not an overarching policy or specific enactment of that policy: in Tariff terms, that is a regulation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all of the other members states are permitted to manage some aspects that influence trade policy, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>VAT</li>
<li>Excise</li>
<li>National prohibitions and restrictions</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="measure-types-amp-responsibilities">Measure types &amp; responsibilities</h2>
<ul>
<li>There are c. 260 measure types in existence prior to the end of the Transition Period (TP).</li>
<li>Some of these have not been used in some time and can be considered as dead, even if they are not formally terminated on the database.</li>
<li>c. 80 of these are VAT and excise measures that DIT will never get involved in</li>
<li>There remain about 85 measure types that will crop up over the course of the next year and will need to be understood, even if some of these are going to be omitted from the UK tariff (in the first instance).</li>
<li>The measure types can be broadly broken in to the following groups, with the table below showing the division of responsibility between the EU and the member states, represented for the UK by HMRC.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/93492809-26d60600-f903-11ea-9e0e-983b4d4db74a.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/93492809-26d60600-f903-11ea-9e0e-983b4d4db74a.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<p>After the Transition Period, there will be a great degree of similarity in the applicable trade measures. The UK is not revolutionising the types of trade measures that are to be imposed.</p>
<p>These groups of measure types are detailed in subsequent pages.</p>

<h2 id="measures-and-geographical-areas">Measures and geographical areas</h2><p>The data model allows a single measure to be attached to a single geographical area.</p>
<p>In this context a geographical area can mean:</p>

<ul>
<li>a single country (or region1)</li>
<li>a group of countries</li>
</ul>
<p>The group of countries may be a formal trading bloc, like the EU or CARIFORUM (Caribbean Trading Nations)</p>
<p>In the geography is a group, then individual countries within that group may also be excluded.</p>
<p>For example, while Haiti is a part of CARIFORUM (both officially and in the Tariff), it is excluded from all preferential measures of the Caribbean EPA (Economic Partnership Agreement), as it has yet to ratify the treaty.</p>

<h2 id="measures-and-commodity-codes">Measures and commodity codes</h2>
<ul>
<li>A measure is applied to a single commodity code only</li>
<li>While a trade instrument (FTA, import restriction etc.) may and is likely to cover multiple commodity codes, this results in the creation of many individual measures.</li>
<li>The Tariff database employs inheritance to apply measures – there are up to 13 tiers in the commodity code hierarchy.</li>
<li>In theory, a measure can be applied at any tier in that hierarchy and inherited down. In practice, measures are very rarely assigned at HS chapter (the first tier in the hierarchy).</li>
<li>While this inheritance is great for accelerating the creation of measures, it brings complexity in terms of business rule adherence.</li>
<li>A measure cannot exist in a hierarchy in the same context (i.e. same measure type, same comm code tree, same date period, same measure type etc.) more than once.</li>
<li>So there is no concept of applying a measure at a higher tier in the database and then having it superseded by a more granular exception in a lower tier – you need to be explicit when assigning measures.</li>
<li>Thus, if  commodity X has 10 children, 9 of which require a 0% duty and 1 of which requires a 50% duty, then you must assign the duties explicitly to all 10 commodities</li>
<li>See the commodity code training manual for more information, especially re: business processing rule ME32.</li>
<li>A commodity code or goods nomenclature item is assigned to a measure via two fields, both of which point to the same data item (goods_nomenclature_item_id and goods_nomenclature_sid).</li>
<li>While a commodity code is fully characterised also by its productline_suffix (in places misspelled as producline_suffix), all measures must be assigned to commodity codes with a productline_suffix of 80, therefore this data would be superfluous on the the measure table.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="measures-and-additional-codes">Measures and additional codes</h2><p>A measure can be assigned to a single additional code only.</p>
<p>As with commodity codes, there are multiple fields used to link the measure to the single additional code:</p>

<ul>
<li>additional_code_type_id</li>
<li>additional_code_id</li>
<li>additional_code_sid</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike commodity codes, there is no concept of inheritance with additional codes – the code is given meaning solely by the additional code type (single digit); the additional code ID (three digits) is essentially a meaningless sequentially sourced number.</p>
<p>An additional code is assigned to a measure for multiple reasons, which could potentially be extended in the future:</p>

<ul>
<li>to reference a specific company which will be assigned anti-dumping or anti-subsidy duties</li>
<li>to reference the route of ingress into the Union (wheat &amp; other cereals)</li>
<li>to reference product usage (e.g. pharmaceutical usage gets a reduced import duty)</li>
<li>to reference goods pillaged from Syria &amp; Iraq</li>
<li>to reference the %age content of sugar, flour or milk fats/solids.</li>
</ul>
<p>See the additional codes training manual for more information on why additional codes are used.</p>
<h2 id="measures-and-time-periods">Measures and time periods</h2>
<ul>
<li>Like most (but not all) objects on the tariff database, measures come with validity_start_date and validity_end_date fields.</li>
<li>For measures, validity start dates are mandatory, whereas validity end dates are optional and usually left blank.</li>
<li>Measure start dates usually coincide with the start dates of the regulations that engender them, though that is not always the case: the regulation also usually has no end date.</li>
<li>A measure will have and end date when it is intended to be explicitly end-dated, e.g. a measure related to a quota, where a limited balance is available for a specific period of time, or agri measures which are intended to be updated on a metronomic basis, e.g. unit prices, if we choose to adopt these.</li>
<li>Even though the Taric business processing rules document states that the measure start date under certain circumstances is optional, it is wrong.</li>
<li>The schema requires a measure start date in the format yyyy-mm-dd</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Validity start dates and end dates are treated differently in the Tariff.</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Validity start date means 00:00 at the start of the day</li>
<li>Validity end date means 00:00 at the end of the day.</li>
<li>Therefore a measure that starts on Jan 1st and also ends on Jan 1st lasts for a full 24 hours and not zero hours.</li>
<li>There is no concept of time in the tariff for ‘Taric’ measures, i.e. those that fit into the normal EU schema, which we are adopting.</li>
<li>However, for VAT and excise, the concept of time has been introduced, as this is required to time changes with budget speeches.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="measures-and-regulations">Measures and regulations</h2><p>A measure is associated to two sets of regulations, depending on its status. These are referred to as follows:</p>

<ins>Measure-generating regulations:</ins>

<ul>
<li>The measure-generating regulation is mandatory for all measures.</li>
<li><p>This is the regulation that gives measures their legal base. The reference to the measure-generating regulation is split into two fields</p>

<ul>
<li>measure_generating_regulation_role</li>
<li>measure_generating_regulation_id</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ins>Justification regulations:</ins>

<ul>
<li>The term “justification” regulation is short-hand for “justification for closing” – it is used to identify the legal base that causes the regulation to be terminated in the EU. The UK does not have a similar kind of legislative function – we will not be using the justification regulation as a way of formally auditing the closure of regulations. But there are business rules that make this piece of data critical.</li>
<li>A justification regulation is not created when a measure is started unless an end-date is also supplied – however, if an end date is supplied, then the justification regulation is mandatory. If the end-date is not entered, then the justification regulation must not be supplied.</li>
<li>The justification regulation must be either:

<ul>
<li>the measure’s measure-generating regulation, or</li>
<li>a measure-generating regulation, valid on the day after the measure’s (explicit) end date.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When we end-date measures in TAP, we always use the measure-generating regulation as the justification regulation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="measures-and-footnotes">Measures and footnotes</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is possible to apply footnotes to both commodity codes and to measures.</li>
<li>As with anything else associated to the measure, the footnote is inherited down to child comm codes – therefore if a measure with a footnote is assigned at HS chapter, then both the measure and the footnote are inherited down to all comm codes in that chapter.</li>
<li>A footnote is connected to the measure by a linking table (many-to-many) called footnote_association_measures.</li>
<li>Footnotes are linked to measures for the entirety of the measure’s duration – the association does not have its own start and end dates – which differs from footnotes’ association with commodity codes, which are dated.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/93493734-2722d100-f904-11ea-8be2-6abee348e61b.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/93493734-2722d100-f904-11ea-8be2-6abee348e61b.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<h2 id="measures-and-duties">Measures and duties</h2>
<ul>
<li>Duties are applicable to some, but not all measures. If the measure type is set up with data on the “measure_component_applicable_code” field of “0” or “1”, then a component may / must be applied. If the value of this field is “2”, then the component is not permitted.</li>
<li>Examples of where a duty is mandatory are 103 (Third country duty (MFN)) and 142 (Tariff preference)</li>
<li>Examples of where a duty is not permitted are the majority of the prohibition and restriction measures.</li>
<li>Duties may be held in one of two places:

<ul>
<li>directly assigned to the measure under all circumstances</li>
<li>conditionally assigned to the measure in certain conditions</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ins>Directly-assigned duties</ins>

<ul>
<li>Directly-assigned duties are assigned to measures via the measure_components table</li>
<li>A duty (direct- or conditionally-assigned) is often made up of more than one component, which are sequenced in ascending order, according to their duty_expression ID</li>
</ul>

<ins>Conditionally-assigned duties</ins>

<ul>
<li>Conditionally-assigned duties are assigned to measures via the measure_condition_components table, via the measure_conditions table.</li>
<li>These state that a certain condition needs to be fulfilled for the duty to apply, e.g. a certain entry price or supply of a certificate.</li>
<li>These relationships are described in full in the measure components training manual.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="measure-components-and-measure-condition-components">Measure components and measure condition components</h2><p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/93494129-96002a00-f904-11ea-9907-935378ced1a8.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/93494129-96002a00-f904-11ea-9907-935378ced1a8.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<h2 id="measures-conditions-and-certificates">Measures, conditions and certificates</h2>
<ul>
<li>A measure can be assigned any number of conditions. These are described in full in the measure conditions training manual, but are used to describe to the border systems:

<ul>
<li>duties that apply under certain circumstances</li>
<li>border control restrictions that apply under certain circumstances), such as the imposition of requiring a certificate or another kind of document.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There is no limit to the number of conditions that can be assigned to a single measure, though the current max (Feb 2020) is 26 conditions.</li>
<li>Please see the detailed “measure conditions” guide for a full overview of conditions in all their different flavours.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/93494567-14f56280-f905-11ea-83a5-d24ddd9940c1.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/93494567-14f56280-f905-11ea-83a5-d24ddd9940c1.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<h2 id="relationship-between-measures-and-quotas">Relationship between measures and quotas</h2>
<ul>
<li>While First Come, First Served (FCFS) quotas are entirely separate objects on the database, it is not possible to allow traders to declare against quotas unless there is a quota measure exposing its presence to the trader – all trade instruments that are to be executed in CHIEF or CDS need measures to make them work.</li>
<li>Similarly, licensed quotas are operated via measures, though they do not have the additional quota data structures associated with them that are used by FCFS quotas.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/93494596-1c1c7080-f905-11ea-9aa7-b11dd6767b1d.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/93494596-1c1c7080-f905-11ea-9aa7-b11dd6767b1d.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li>The quota structures are linked to the measures via the use of the ordernumber field. This field takes a 6-digit quota order number and is the same data that is managed in the quota_order_number_id field of the quota_order_number table and similar.</li>
<li>For licensed quotas, the data is also entered into this field as a 6-digit code, but always starts ”094”.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="modifying-measures">Modifying measures</h2>
<ul>
<li>In most cases, making a change to a measure is not actually a case of actually modifying that measure entity, nor the ancillary objects (such as conditions and components).</li>
<li>Most fundamental changes to a measure are achieved by terminating the measure and replacing with an alternative from the date on which the change is scheduled to happen – otherwise, you run the risk of making changes to measures which have already been active and possibly declared against by traders: to change already live data, e.g. the commodity code or the applicable duties is simply not done.</li>
<li><p>Let’s say the action were to change the measure type of a given measure such that it evolves from being a 551 (provisional anti-dumping duty) to being a 552, a final anti-dumping duty (known as definitive anti-dumping on the EU tariff). Though this is a required use case, it would never be a case of just updating the measure type of the existing measure.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>the tariff manager would need to provide a date on which to make the change, which should be no earlier than tomorrow</li>
<li>the existing measure is terminated on the date before the supplied change date</li>
<li>a new measure, effectively a clone, is created starting on the change date, with the old measure type replaced with the new.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This applies equally to the measure-generating regulation, the geography to which the measure applies, the applicable duties and conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, changing fundamental details of the measure, such as the quota order number or the reduction indicator are to be achieved via replacing the measure.</p></li>
<li><p>If the user is wanting to modify the assigned footnotes, then there is no need to clone the measure: adding a footnote to the existing measure is fine.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-stopped-flag">The stopped flag</h2>
<ul>
<li>The stopped flag is set to ‘true’ when a regulation ends a measure using a specific function called ‘abrogation’.</li>
<li>This both sets the effective end date in the regulation and the stopped flag in the measures table.</li>
<li>In the UK we are not using this, however be aware that the stopped flag is mandatory.</li>
<li>Please always set the stopped flag to false in all cases.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92634413-2ff42100-f2cc-11ea-81d0-3d589cc452e0.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92634413-2ff42100-f2cc-11ea-81d0-3d589cc452e0.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h2 id="explosion-level">Explosion level</h2>
<ul>
<li>While this is a field that pertains to the measure type and not the measure itself, it is worth bringing it up here. The explosion level field can formally take 5 values, as per the XSD to the right, however in practice, only the values “8” and “10” are used.</li>
<li>The explosion level indicates how far down the goods classification hierarchy a measure can be assigned and the explosion level corresponds to the significant digits in the comm code. Treating comm codes as being 5 pairs of 2 digits …</li>
<li>11 12 13 10 00 – 8 significant digits (despite the 8th being a zero)</li>
<li>11 12 13 14 00 – 8 significant digits</li>
<li>11 12 13 14 10 – 10 significant digits (despite the 10th being a zero)</li>
<li>11 12 13 14 15 – 10 significant digits</li>
<li>Measures of a measure type that is set to an explosion level of 8 cannot be assigned to the 3rd and 4th of the commodity codes above.</li>
<li>Measures of a measure type that is set to an explosion level of 10 can be assigned to literally any commodity code.</li>
<li>This impacts business rule ME88 (see below).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92635147-451d7f80-f2cd-11ea-86d4-4f8e224f1906.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92635147-451d7f80-f2cd-11ea-86d4-4f8e224f1906.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h2 id="the-reduction-indicator">The reduction indicator</h2>
<ul>
<li>This field is used to apply preferential Meursing tables to measures.</li>
<li>The field is not mandatory and in most countries is set to null.</li>
<li>Alternative values are 1 to 6, which specify the reduction level to be applied to Meursing placeholders. </li>
<li>This is discussed in the agricultural duties training manual.
<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92635079-2cad6500-f2cd-11ea-9d4b-713b85d04f59.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92635079-2cad6500-f2cd-11ea-9d4b-713b85d04f59.png" alt="" /></a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="export-refunds">Export refunds</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>The export refund nomenclature was a specific nomenclature used for the refund on the export of some agricultural products. This nomenclature is composed of a CN code linked to a 4-digit code called &ldquo;Export refund additional code&rdquo;.</p></li>
<li><p>This has been abandoned since 2013, so the field export_refund_nomenclature_sid should be set to null in all cases.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="entering-duties">Entering duties</h2><h3 id="duty-sentence-deconstructor">Duty sentence deconstructor</h3>
<ul>
<li>While this offers a decent route to ensure that no business rules are contravened, it is problematic in terms of screen space, especially for complex conditions, where multiple duties are dependent on those conditions.</li>
<li>In addition, it uses a lot of JavaScript, which is not great for accessibility.</li>
<li>Therefore the approach was taken to prototype something simpler – the nattily named duty sentence deconstructor.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92720962-44342e80-f35d-11ea-95a1-8a3cebe7c35c.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92720962-44342e80-f35d-11ea-95a1-8a3cebe7c35c.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li>This tool is designed to allows you to copy and paste or type any kind of duty string in to a field and have it translated into an actual set of measure components, abided by all the Taric business rules (e.g. only ever using one duty expressions once against a measure).</li>
<li>The page is unconnected at the moment, but has tested well, both in terms of its usage by policy team members and in terms of translating strings to components.</li>
<li>The tool works via a combination of JavaScript (which is optional) and backend string replacement (in PHP, but easy to replicate in Python).</li>
<li>The tool differentiates between supplementary unit measure types and all others – supplementary units expect to receive only a unit and in extremis a measurement unit qualifier [KGM E (per 1,000), KGM C (net of drained weight) and KGM S (of sugar with a yield in white sugar of 92%) are used] very infrequently.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92721214-a3923e80-f35d-11ea-9693-7d680391751f.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92721214-a3923e80-f35d-11ea-9693-7d680391751f.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li>The MFN measure for white chocolate is on of the more complex duties on the EU tariff. The UK is unlikely to use anything so complex, but must be able to handle similar duties, in case we revert to this level of complexity. The duty is as follows:

<ul>
<li>9.10 % + 45.10 EUR / 100 kg</li>
<li>MAX 18.90 % + 16.50 EUR / 100 kg</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you copy this into the Duty field, you get a translation of it into the 4 clauses (parts field) and from there into the 4 respective measure components</li>
<li>Most important thing to note is that actually clauses 1, 3 and 4 are effectively the same duty expression – the tool has worked out not to repeat an existing duty expression, hence 01 becomes 04, which becomes 19, so as to not repeat and break business rule ME43.</li>
<li>The validity column is just a check (adding 1, 2, 4 and 8 to make 15) that the expression is valid according to the criteria noted bottom left.</li>
<li>The PHP is rough and ready but should be easily interpretable for translation into Python and componentisation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="screens-measures">Screens – measures</h2><h3 id="search-for-measures">Search for measures</h3><p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92721601-43e86300-f35e-11ea-972e-74a54987c413.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92721601-43e86300-f35e-11ea-972e-74a54987c413.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li>The search screen is vastly cut down in comparison to the existing TAP measure search screen.</li>
<li>This is a) to save on development time and b) because much of the functionality has not proven to be particularly useful – the original project delivered the capability to search on anything.</li>
<li>Performance is a challenge on search results, as the data needs to be returned from multiple tables, especially re: duties and conditions, and especially where the SQL contains a LIKE clause.</li>
<li>Search should be against at least all of the criteria on the screen to the left.</li>
<li>In the case of commodity code and regulation, the operator dropdown should include both “is one of” and “starts with” to allow exact matches, stemmed matches and searches against multiple precise items (by request of the policy team).</li>
<li>Use type ahead on measure type, geography and quota order number fields.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="measures-search-results">Measures search results</h2><p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92721862-a5a8cd00-f35e-11ea-9711-5d2802ac3173.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92721862-a5a8cd00-f35e-11ea-9711-5d2802ac3173.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<p>Search results screen is common across most data objects – with measures (and quotas), the most important point to note is that there is no left-hand side filter capability - there is no room, as there is so much data that need to be returned. Search results table must include:</p>

<ul>
<li>View of number of results returned (above and below table)</li>
<li>Link to export the entire dataset (not just the current page) to CSV</li>
<li>Button to work with selected measures (both above and below the table)</li>
<li>Table in GDS table style, but with font size shrunk to 12 point to fit the requisite volume of data.</li>
<li>Table headers with sort controls, as appropriate (no value in sorting on measure_sid, duties, exclusions, conditions, footnotes, status).</li>
<li>Tooltip controls on table headers where appropriate – on this form especially useful on the conditions column, which is complex</li>
<li>For the measure SID column, it must be possible to select all measures, for use in the “work with” functions</li>
<li>For each measure, click on the measure_sid column value to navigate to the specific measure</li>
<li>Click on data in the regulation column to navigate to that regulation.</li>
<li>Click on data in the type (measure type) column to navigate to that measure type.</li>
<li>Click on data in the additional code column to navigate to that additional code.</li>
<li>Click on data in the geography and exclusions column to navigate to that geography.</li>
<li>Click on data in the QON (Quota order number) column to navigate to that quota order number.</li>
<li>Show status as icon</li>
<li>Under table show paging – this screen grab has been doctored to show only 10 results: suggestion is 100 results per page for measures.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="display-of-complex-conditions">Display of complex conditions</h2><p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92722197-21a31500-f35f-11ea-995f-b4d6bf4cd03c.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92722197-21a31500-f35f-11ea-995f-b4d6bf4cd03c.png" alt="image" /></a></p>
<p>The data in the conditions column is potentially very complicated and needs to be represented on the search results form – especially with Trade Remedies, the duties may be held in the conditions and this is perhaps the critical piece of information being sought.</p>
<p>The colour coding is helpful in separating out the components of a condition, all of which are important to the processing of the data in CDS, Gems and Caesar</p>
<p>For each line in the conditions column, this is what is meant:</p>

<ul>
<li>blue – the condition code and sequence number</li>
<li>purple – the reference price (import price greater than …)</li>
<li>red – the required certificate</li>
<li>green – the action code</li>
<li>black – the applicable duties</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all elements are likely to occur together – in fact the nature of conditions is such that there will either be a reference price or there will be a requirement for a certificate, not both, as per the example above. Taking the first row, against commodity 85 41 40 90 41 and additional code B845, the following data applies:</p>

<p>The import control team should eventually review the complexity of this and reduce, however it is unlikely to happen for day one.</p>

</tr><tr>
<td>ME1</td>
<td>The combination of measure type + geographical area +   goods nomenclature item id + additional code type + additional code + order   number + reduction indicator + start date must be unique.</td>
<td>Required – extremely high priority     This is actually an understatement of the business rule.   There must be no crossover in dates (start or end date) of measures that shar   the same context (as described by the fields to the left). It is more than   just the start date. This and ME32 can be handled together: develop ME32 and   ME1 falls into place.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ME2</td>
<td>The measure type must exist.</td>
<td>Required – low priority     Measure types will need to be selected from a dropdown   (typeahead), but this should be checked nonetheless</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ME3</td>
<td>The validity period of the measure type must span the   validity period of the measure.</td>
<td>Required – low priority     Any date related business rule should be avoided by the   Tariff managers simply not end-dating things – there is no real need to   end-date a measure type, and this should be reasserted.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ME4</td>
<td>The geographical area must exist.</td>
<td>Required – low priority     As per the measure type, this should be avoided by   selecting from a list, however this should be checked.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ME5</td>
<td>The validity period of the geographical area must span the   validity period of the measure.</td>
<td>Required – low priority     As per the measure type check, this is required, but can   be avoided by not end-dating geographical areas (which is unnecessary).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ME6</td>
<td>The goods code must exist.</td>
<td>Required – high priority     Required – this should be checked on first entering the   commodity codes (goods code, commodity code, good nomenclature item id are   all synonymous)</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ME7</td>
<td>The goods nomenclature code must be a product code; that   is, it may not be an intermediate line.</td>
<td>Required – high priority     This means that the commodity code must exist with a product   line suffix of “80” and not any other value which would reflect the fact that   the commodity is an intermediate heading and nothing more.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ME8</td>
<td>The validity period of the goods code must span the   validity period of the measure.</td>
<td>Required – high priority     This is one of the more critical rules – commodity   codes do start and end on a regular basis and there must be no commodity   codes that terminate before the end date of the assigned measure(s).     This applies equally to open-ended measures on   commodity codes that are end-dated. If a commodity code is being end-dated,   and there will be a requirement to do so, then any measures against that   commodity code must also be terminated.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ME88</td>
<td>The level of the goods code, if present, cannot exceed the   explosion level of the measure type.</td>
<td>Required – medium priority     This is primarily aimed at export control measures,   which are set at 8-digits rather than at the 10-digits that are reserved for   import measure types. Explosion level is set against the measure type, and   not the measure itself. If the user attempts to assign a measure to a   10-digit commodity when the explosion level is set to 8, then ME88 will be   triggered (see page earlier in deck re: explosion level).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ME16</td>
<td>Integrating a measure with an additional code when an   equivalent or overlapping measures without additional code already exists and   vice-versa, should be forbidden.</td>
<td>Required – high priority     This mostly impacts trade remedies, but also EU   additional code types (most of which will not carry forward), such as route   of ingress additional codes (see separate guide). What this means is that, if   there are measures set up against a combination of a commodity code and an   additional code, then it is not permitted to set up a measure against just   that commodity code (without the additional code).     For instance – a Trade Remedy is in place, where this   has involved creating an anti-dumping measure against a commodity code   (0102030405) and an additional code (C233 – Shanghai Industries). The duty   has been set to 25% (punitive specifically against Shanghai Industries).     It must not be possible to set up a measure for the   same time period, of the same type against just comm code 0102030405 with no   additional code. Border systems do not like ambiguity. Instead, the   additional codes presented for that context must cover the full universe of   options – e.g. residual (All other companies A999, B999, C999) codes are set   up for Trade Remedies.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ME115</td>
<td>The validity period of the referenced additional code must   span the validity period of the measure</td>
<td>Required – medium priority     As with all similar rules, this needs to be checked but   should rarely if ever come up, as Tariff Managers should not be end-dating   additional codes.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ME25</td>
<td>If the measure’s end date is specified (implicitly or   explicitly) then the start date of the measure must be less than or equal to   the end date.</td>
<td>Required – low priority     Should be checked as soon as the dates are entered into   the application. End date will in almost all circumstances by empty (Null)   for measures.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>ME32</td>
<td>There may be no overlap in time with other measure   occurrences with a goods code in the same nomenclature hierarchy which   references the same measure type, geo area, order number, additional code and   reduction indicator. This rule is not applicable for Meursing additional   codes.</td>
<td>Required – extremely high priority     This is the mother of all business rules and the one   that is likely to trip DDaT and Tariff Managers up more than any other. This   is an extension of the previously described ME1 to all commodity codes in the   upward hierarchy and all commodity codes in the downward hierarchy.     Therefore it is critical that the development team   works out a way of identifying a commodity’s hierarchy from the available   data. There is no concept of parent / child relationship in the database,   rather a list of sequential numbers and indents which infer the hierarchy.     This business rule is detailed on the next pages and in   the section on import control measures. There are 40+ import control   measures, all of which do broadly one of two things: prohibit goods entirely   from being traded, or require that certain provisions are taken (e.g.   documentation). There are so many measure types precisely to avoid ME32.     See next page for details…</td>

<ul>
<li>As a tariff manager, I have been asked to create a new measure for ERGA OMNES of type “Import control” at level 4 “with a sugar content exceeding 30% by weight” – </li>
<li>There is already a measure of type “Import control” at level 8 “Fruit purees obtained by sieving then brought to the boil in a vacuum, the texture and chemical composition of which have not been changed by the heat treatment”</li>
<li>ME32 says no</li>
<li>I can either rejig the measures in the entire hierarchy to suit to new measure OR …</li>
<li>I can invent a new measure type “Import control for sieved fruit puree” … which is what the EU has done, and which we will also need to do in the future.</li>
