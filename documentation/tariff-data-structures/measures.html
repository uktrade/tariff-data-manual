            <h1 id="measures">Measures</h1><h3 id="introduction-to-measures">Introduction to measures</h3><p>A measure is the fundamental raison d’être of the tariff – every piece of trade legislation that is intended to impact the trade of goods through a country’s borders must end up in a measure (or usually more than one).</p>
<p>If there is no measure, then the border systems will not react.</p>
<p>A measure is an atomic unit: according to the Tariff, it is “the application, during a certain period, of an aspect of the Union tariff and commercial legislation to goods imported from a certain origin or exported to a certain destination” which sums it up quite nicely.</p>
<p>A measure equates to a single line on the “Trade with the UK tool” - https://www.gov.uk/get-rules-tariffs-trade-with-uk</p>
<p>A measure equates to a single line on the Trade Tariff Service (UKTT) - https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/sections</p>
<p>Below is a page from the UKTT for Asses (the animal) – each alternating grey &amp; white line is a single measure. Some commodity codes can have hundreds of measures assigned to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92616091-bbae8300-f2b5-11ea-8997-8fe2a54ffee7.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92616091-bbae8300-f2b5-11ea-8997-8fe2a54ffee7.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h3 id="what-a-measure-is-not">What a measure is not!</h3><p>The tariff is a sea of intermingled terminologies – terms are used in different senses by different policy areas.</p>
<p>For instance, in Trade Remedies, the term ‘measure’ may be synonymous with ‘case’, e.g. an investigation launched by the TRA against multiple companies/countries. In this case, the ‘case’ will of followed through to its conclusion, result in a number of measures, a Tariff would refer to them – in the case of Trade Remedies, this could result in many thousands of Tariff measures.</p>
<p>A measure is not an overarching policy or specific enactment of that policy: in Tariff terms, that is a regulation.</p>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92614019-7ab56f00-f2b3-11ea-88c7-8162a85f9854.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92614019-7ab56f00-f2b3-11ea-88c7-8162a85f9854.png" alt="" /></a></p>
<h3 id="the-uk-tariff-is-currently-a-combination-of-eu-and-national-measures">The UK tariff is currently a combination of EU and national measures</h3><p>Until the end of the Transition Period, we remain a part of the EU’s customs union. As a result of this, we do not get to determine our own trade policy: we cannot enforce our own trade agreements (though we can begin to negotiate them); we cannot impose punitive anti-dumping duties, nor can we decide our own MFN duties.</p>
<p>But we can manage certain aspects of the duties &amp; regulatory controls that are applied to imports and exports.</p>
<p>The EU build all of their measures in their Taric application and then export them overnight for common application across all of the 28 member states (including us). This will continue until (at the earliest) Jan 1st 2021.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the UK (and all of the other members states) as permitted to manage some aspects that influence trade policy, namely:
* VAT
* Excise
* National prohibitions and restrictions</p>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92616495-32e41700-f2b6-11ea-93b3-06889de94145.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/92616495-32e41700-f2b6-11ea-93b3-06889de94145.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<h3 id="measure-types-amp-responsibilities-prior-to-the-tp">Measure types &amp; responsibilities prior to the TP</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are c. 260 measure types in existence prior to the end of the Transition Period (TP).</li>
<li>Some of these have not been used in some time and can be considered as dead, even if they are not formally terminated on the database.</li>
<li>c. 80 of these are VAT and excise measures that DIT will never get involved in</li>
<li>There remain about 85 measure types that will crop up over the course of the next year and will need to be understood, even if some of these are going to be omitted from the UK tariff (in the first instance).</li>
<li>The measure types can be broadly broken in to the following groups, with the table to the right showing the division of responsibility between the EU and the member states, represented for the UK by HMRC.</li>
<li>These will evolve after the TP (Jan 2021).</li>

<p>The major difference in responsibility will see the MTPO team in DIT’s Trade Policy Group replacing the role of the EU in co-ordinating and maintaining the measures that were previously seen as pan-European.</p>

      </div><p>The CVD measure type is a complete duplicate of measure type 410 (Veterinary control) applied in the Taric measures.
Measures of this type are being removed from the UK Tariff in Feb 2020.</p>
<h3 id="measures-and-geographical-areas">Measures and geographical areas</h3><p>The data model allows a single measure to be attached to a single geographical area.</p>
<p>In this context a geographical area can mean:
* a single country (or region1)
* a group of countries</p>
<p>The group of countries may be a formal trading bloc, like the EU or CARIFORUM (Caribbean Trading Nations)</p>
<p>In the geography is a group, then individual countries within that group may also be excluded.</p>
<p>For example, while Haiti is a part of CARIFORUM (both officially and in the Tariff), it is excluded from all preferential measures of the Caribbean EPA (Economic Partnership Agreement), as it has yet to ratify the treaty.</p>
<p>[Insert graph here]</p>
<h3 id="measures-and-commodity-codes">Measures and commodity codes</h3>
<ul>
<li>A measure is applied to a single commodity code only</li>
<li>While a trade instrument (FTA, import restriction etc.) may and is likely to cover multiple commodity codes, this results in the creation of many individual measures.</li>
<li>The Tariff database employs inheritance to apply measures – there are up to 13 tiers in the commodity code hierarchy.</li>
<li>In theory, a measure can be applied at any tier in that hierarchy and inherited down. In practice, measures are very rarely assigned at HS chapter (the first tier in the hierarchy).</li>
<li>While this inheritance is great for accelerating the creation of measures, it brings complexity in terms of business rule adherence.</li>
<li>A measure cannot exist in a hierarchy in the same context (i.e. same measure type, same comm code tree, same date period, same measure type etc.) more than once.</li>
<li>So there is no concept of applying a measure at a higher tier in the database and then having it superseded by a more granular exception in a lower tier – you need to be explicit when assigning measures.</li>
<li>Thus, if  commodity X has 10 children, 9 of which require a 0% duty and 1 of which requires a 50% duty, then you must assign the duties explicitly to all 10 commodities</li>
<li>See the commodity code training manual for more information, especially re: business processing rule ME32.</li>
<li>A commodity code or goods nomenclature item is assigned to a measure via two fields, both of which point to the same data item (goods_nomenclature_item_id and goods_nomenclature_sid).</li>
<li>While a commodity code is fully characterised also by its productline_suffix (in places misspelled as producline_suffix), all measures must be assigned to commodity codes with a productline_suffix of 80, therefore this data would be superfluous on the the measure table.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="measures-and-additional-codes">Measures and additional codes</h3><p>A measure can be assigned to a single additional code only.</p>
<p>As with commodity codes, there are multiple fields used to link the measure to the single additional code:
* additional_code_type_id
* additional_code_id
* additional_code_sid</p>
<p>Unlike commodity codes, there is no concept of inheritance with additional codes – the code is given meaning solely by the additional code type (single digit); the additional code ID (three digits) is essentially a meaningless sequentially sourced number.</p>
<p>An additional code is assigned to a measure for multiple reasons, which could potentially be extended in the future:
* to reference a specific company which will be assigned anti-dumping or anti-subsidy duties
* to reference the route of ingress into the Union (wheat &amp; other cereals)
* to reference product usage (e.g. pharmaceutical usage gets a reduced import duty)
* to reference goods pillaged from Syria &amp; Iraq
* to reference the %age content of sugar, flour or milk fats/solids.</p>
<p>See the additional codes training manual for more information on why additional codes are used.</p>
<h3 id="measures-and-time-periods">Measures and time periods</h3>
<ul>
<li>Like most (but not all) objects on the tariff database, measures come with validity_start_date and validity_end_date fields.</li>
<li>For measures, validity start dates are mandatory, whereas validity end dates are optional and usually left blank.</li>
<li>Measure start dates usually coincide with the start dates of the regulations that engender them, though that is not always the case: the regulation also usually has no end date.</li>
<li>A measure will have and end date when it is intended to be explicitly end-dated, e.g. a measure related to a quota, where a limited balance is available for a specific period of time, or agri measures which are intended to be updated on a metronomic basis, e.g. unit prices, if we choose to adopt these.</li>
<li>Even though the Taric business processing rules document states that the measure start date under certain circumstances is optional, it is wrong.</li>
<li>The schema requires a measure start date in the format yyyy-mm-dd</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Validity start dates and end dates are treated differently in the Tariff.</strong>
* Validity start date means 00:00 at the start of the day
* Validity end date means 00:00 at the end of the day.
* Therefore a measure that starts on Jan 1st and also ends on Jan 1st lasts for a full 24 hours and not zero hours.
* There is no concept of time in the tariff for ‘Taric’ measures, i.e. those that fit into the normal EU schema, which we are adopting.
* However, for VAT and excise, the concept of time has been introduced, as this is required to time changes with budget speeches.</p>
<h3 id="measures-and-regulations">Measures and regulations</h3><p>A measure is associated to two sets of regulations, depending on its status. These are referred to as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Measure-generating regulations</strong>
* The measure-generating regulation is mandatory for all measures.
* This is the regulation that gives measures their legal base. The reference to the measure-generating regulation is split into two fields
  - measure_generating_regulation_role
  - measure_generating_regulation_id</p>
<p><strong>Justification regulations</strong>
* The term “justification” regulation is short-hand for “justification for closing” – it is used to identify the legal base that causes the regulation to be terminated in the EU. The UK does not have a similar kind of legislative function – we will not be using the justification regulation as a way of formally auditing the closure of regulations. But there are business rules that make this piece of data critical.
* A justification regulation is not created when a measure is started unless an end-date is also supplied – however, if an end date is supplied, then the justification regulation is mandatory. If the end-date is not entered, then the justification regulation must not be supplied.
* The justification regulation must be either:
 - the measure’s measure-generating regulation, or
 - a measure-generating regulation, valid on the day after the measure’s (explicit) end date.
* When we end-date measures in TAP, we always use the measure-generating regulation as the justification regulation.</p>
<h3 id="measures-and-footnotes">Measures and footnotes</h3>
<ul>
<li>It is possible to apply footnotes to both commodity codes and to measures.</li>
<li>As with anything else associated to the measure, the footnote is inherited down to child comm codes – therefore if a measure with a footnote is assigned at HS chapter, then both the measure and the footnote are inherited down to all comm codes in that chapter.</li>
<li>A footnote is connected to the measure by a linking table (many-to-many) called footnote_association_measures.</li>
<li>Footnotes are linked to measures for the entirety of the measure’s duration – the association does not have its own start and end dates – which differs from footnotes’ association with commodity codes, which are dated.</li>
</ul>
<p>[insert graph]</p>
<h3 id="measures-and-duties">Measures and duties</h3>
<ul>
<li>Duties are applicable to some, but not all measures. If the measure type is set up with data on the “measure_component_applicable_code” field of “0” or “1”, then a component may / must be applied. If the value of this field is “2”, then the component is not permitted.</li>
<li>Examples of where a duty is mandatory are 103 (Third country duty (MFN)) and 142 (Tariff preference)</li>
<li>Examples of where a duty is not permitted are the majority of the prohibition and restriction measures.</li>
<li>Duties may be held in one of two places:

<ul>
<li>directly assigned to the measure under all circumstances</li>
<li>conditionally assigned to the measure in certain conditions</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Directly-assigned duties</strong>
* Directly-assigned duties are assigned to measures via the measure_components table
* A duty (direct- or conditionally-assigned) is often made up of more than one component, which are sequenced in ascending order, according to their duty_expression ID</p>
<p><strong>Conditionally-assigned duties</strong>
* Conditionally-assigned duties are assigned to measures via the measure_condition_components table, via the measure_conditions table.
* These state that a certain condition needs to be fulfilled for the duty to apply, e.g. a certain entry price or supply of a certificate.
* These relationships are described in full in the measure components training manual.</p>

<h3 id="measures-conditions-and-certificates">Measures, conditions and certificates</h3>
<ul>
<li>A measure can be assigned any number of conditions. These are described in full in the measure conditions training manual, but are used to describe to the border systems:

<ul>
<li>duties that apply under certain circumstances</li>
<li>border control restrictions that apply under certain circumstances), such as the imposition of requiring a certificate or another kind of document.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>There is no limit to the number of conditions that can be assigned to a single measure, though the current max (Feb 2020) is 26 conditions.</li>
<li>Please see the detailed “measure conditions” guide for a full overview of conditions in all their different flavours.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="relationship-between-measures-and-quotas">Relationship between measures and quotas</h3>
<ul>
<li>While First Come, First Served (FCFS) quotas are entirely separate objects on the database, it is not possible to allow traders to declare against quotas unless there is a quota measure exposing its presence to the trader – all trade instruments that are to be executed in CHIEF or CDS need measures to make them work.</li>
<li>Similarly, licensed quotas are operated via measures, though they do not have the additional quota data structures associated with them that are used by FCFS quotas.</li>
</ul>
<p>[insert graph]</p>

<ul>
<li>The quota structures are linked to the measures via the use of the ordernumber field. This field takes a 6-digit quota order number and is the same data that is managed in the quota_order_number_id field of the quota_order_number table and similar.</li>
<li>For licensed quotas, the data is also entered into this field as a 6-digit code, but always starts ”094”.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="modifying-measures">Modifying measures</h3>
<ul>
<li>In most cases, making a change to a measure is not actually a case of actually modifying that measure entity, nor the ancillary objects (such as conditions and components).</li>
<li>Most fundamental changes to a measure are achieved by terminating the measure and replacing with an alternative from the date on which the change is scheduled to happen – otherwise, you run the risk of making changes to measures which have already been active and possibly declared against by traders: to change already live data, e.g. the commodity code or the applicable duties is simply not done.</li>
<li><p>Let’s say the action were to change the measure type of a given measure such that it evolves from being a 551 (provisional anti-dumping duty) to being a 552, a final anti-dumping duty (known as definitive anti-dumping on the EU tariff). Though this is a required use case, it would never be a case of just updating the measure type of the existing measure.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>the tariff manager would need to provide a date on which to make the change, which should be no earlier than tomorrow</li>
<li>the existing measure is terminated on the date before the supplied change date</li>
<li>a new measure, effectively a clone, is created starting on the change date, with the old measure type replaced with the new.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>This applies equally to the measure-generating regulation, the geography to which the measure applies, the applicable duties and conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition, changing fundamental details of the measure, such as the quota order number or the reduction indicator are to be achieved via replacing the measure.</p></li>
<li><p>If the user is wanting to modify the assigned footnotes, then there is no need to clone the measure: adding a footnote to the existing measure is fine.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-stopped-flag">The stopped flag</h3>
<ul>
<li>The stopped flag is set to ‘true’ when a regulation ends a measure using a specific function called ‘abrogation’.</li>
<li>This both sets the effective end date in the regulation and the stopped flag in the measures table.</li>
<li>In the UK we are not using this, however be aware that the stopped flag is mandatory.</li>
<li>Please always set the stopped flag to false in all cases.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="explosion-level">Explosion level</h3>
<ul>
<li>While this is a field that pertains to the measure type and not the measure itself, it is worth bringing it up here. The explosion level field can formally take 5 values, as per the XSD to the right, however in practice, only the values “8” and “10” are used.</li>
<li>The explosion level indicates how far down the goods classification hierarchy a measure can be assigned and the explosion level corresponds to the significant digits in the comm code. Treating comm codes as being 5 pairs of 2 digits …</li>
<li>11 12 13 10 00 – 8 significant digits (despite the 8th being a zero)</li>
<li>11 12 13 14 00 – 8 significant digits</li>
<li>11 12 13 14 10 – 10 significant digits (despite the 10th being a zero)</li>
<li>11 12 13 14 15 – 10 significant digits</li>
<li>Measures of a measure type that is set to an explosion level of 8 cannot be assigned to the 3rd and 4th of the commodity codes above.</li>
<li>Measures of a measure type that is set to an explosion level of 10 can be assigned to literally any commodity code.</li>
<li>This impacts business rule ME88 (see below).</li>

<p>The reduction indicator
* This field is used to apply preferential Meursing tables to measures.
* The field is not mandatory and in most countries is set to null.
* Alternative values are 1 to 6, which specify the reduction level to be applied to Meursing placeholders. 
* This is discussed in the agricultural duties training manual.

<h3 id="export-refunds">Export refunds</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The export refund nomenclature was a specific nomenclature used for the refund on the export of some agricultural products. This nomenclature is composed of a CN code linked to a 4-digit code called &quot;Export refund additional code&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>This has been abandoned since 2013, so the field export_refund_nomenclature_sid should be set to null in all cases.</p></li>
