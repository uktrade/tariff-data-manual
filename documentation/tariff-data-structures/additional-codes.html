<blockquote>
<p>Additional codes are used when the 10-digit commodity code is not enough to identify the product that is being traded, for example, for trade remedy purposes, most additional codes identify the companies that the trade is coming from.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="introduction-to-additional-codes">Introduction to additional codes</h2><h3 id="what-is-an-additional-code">What is an additional code?</h3>
<ul>
<li>As detailed in the training manual on goods nomenclature (commodity codes), in most cases, the 10 digits of the EU commodity code hierarchy are fully sufficient to identify the product that is being traded.</li>
<li>However, there are certain scenarios where the 10-digits are not enough and an additional 4 digits are required (and sometimes 8) to communicate sufficient information to describe the trade.</li>
<li>This is where additional codes come in.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/93084648-4e6f6900-f68c-11ea-8a65-5981fae25376.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/93084648-4e6f6900-f68c-11ea-8a65-5981fae25376.png" alt="image" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li>Additional codes may be appended to a commodity code to make the number of (effective) digits up to 14, or possibly 18.</li>
<li>Importantly though, there is no such thing as a 14-digit commodity code: commodity codes can be augmented by additional codes, but the two entities are managed completely separately: a single additional code can and usually is appended to multiple commodity codes through the medium of measures; similarly a single commodity code can have an association with multiple additional codes, again through measures applied to a given combination of commodity and additional code.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-are-additional-codes-used-for">What are additional codes used for?</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Additional codes are now used to manage:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Meursing codes</strong> – for sugar, flour and milk duties associated with complex agricultural products</li>
<li><strong>Anti-dumping &amp; anti-subsidy duties</strong> – to identify the specific company to which a punitive measure is attached</li>
<li><strong>Pharma products</strong> – to identify that the end use of an imported good is for pharmaceutical purposes, and therefore attracts a reduced duty</li>
<li><strong>Differentiating product states / uses / origins</strong> (e.g. waste chemicals, underwear [!])</li>
<li><strong>Route of ingress</strong> – to identify the route goods (wheat &amp; other cereals) take into EU and to apply different tariff or regulatory treatment</li>
<li><strong>Works of art</strong> – to identify items stolen from Syria and Iraq as a result of wartime activity</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Each of the above uses are discussed in detail on the following slides.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional codes are made up of 4 digits, which are split into two parts:
<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/93085607-b6727f00-f68d-11ea-8e91-6da831303f6e.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/93085607-b6727f00-f68d-11ea-8e91-6da831303f6e.png" alt="image" /></a></p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="structure-of-additional-codes-and-additional-code-types">Structure of additional codes and additional code types</h3>
<ul>
<li>Much like certificates and footnotes, additional codes are made up of a type and then a specific ID, which, when concatenated, form the unique ID of the additional code. .</li>
<li>For example, the additional code C233 is constructed of a type &copy; and a specific footnote ID (233) – the entire additional code is known as C233.</li>
<li>The numeric IDs, running from 001 to 999 can be reused across multiple additional code type IDs.</li>
<li>While the schema allows for us to use alphanumeric digits for additional codes, not just numeric, these are almost never used and never by the EU – there are 7 national additional codes that are used by HMRC for VAT and excise.</li>
<li>The use of the alphanumeric codes may be of great importance to the Northern Ireland protocol, subject to the way in which the solution progresses.</li>
<li>Additional code type IDs are always single alphabetical characters (those set by the EU) or single numeric characters (set as national additional code by the UK).</li>
</ul>

<td>These   codes have been instituted as a means of instituting temporary controls   (restrictions) on goods that have been plundered following the chaos in Iraq   and Syria, for example after the destruction of Palmyra. Rather than   permanently splitting existing commodity codes, typically (but not   exclusively) in chapters 97 and 98 (works of art) etc., the European   Commission has created additional codes to determine origin of goods, even if   they have passed through multiple trades prior to the entry into the EU. For   this reason, many of the controls apply not just to Iraq and Syria, but also   to Erga Omnes / All third countries (1011, 1008 respectively).          Chapters   97 and 98 are very shallow – in some cases, the definitions only go down to   HS4 without any further cleaving of codes – the EU cannot introduce codes at   6 digits, even if that was desirable, so the choice would have been: create a   very few additional codes to designate source OR create a large number of   10-digit codes to represent permanent splits.</td>

<ul>
<li>Introduced in 1988 by the European Commission. Traders hate them, but we have to keep Meursing classifications or change our WTO commitments.</li>
<li>They apply to bakery and confectionery products, etc. classed as “composite agrigoods”. Meursing allows extra set of import duties to be charged depending on how much of 4 agricultural ingredients are used to make the product: milk fat, milk proteins, starch or glucose, or various forms of sugar.</li>
<li>The result used to be tens of thousands of categories of composite agrigoods for the purposes of charging import duties. To find the specific &lsquo;recipe&rsquo; and the duties applicable, you look it up in the Meursing table (right).</li>
<li>Executed in the tariff as a combination of primary measures, such as tariff preferences, with complex duty expression combinations, which are then expanded when the trader select the ‘additional code’ for the specific ‘recipe’ of their product.</li>
<li>The best description of Meursing codes and their use is drawn up by Trade expert Peter Unghpakorn on his trade beta blog: https://tradebetablog.wordpress.com/2016/08/18/eu-tariff-biscuit-annex1/</li>

<h2 id="future-of-meursing-codes">Future of Meursing codes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Meursing code is a staple of EU agrifood trade.</li>
<li>The UK policy however is to abandon Meursing codes as an agricultural policy, due to the fact that it is universally disliked by trade and policy (Defra) alike – the tax-raising reasons for it having come into existence in the first place are not UK policy.</li>
<li>However, as with much of the Northern Ireland protocol, there are additional implications for UK government and Northern Ireland traders with NI remaining in a special relationship with the EU’s Customs Union.</li>
<li>Initial thoughts are that the impact of the NI protocol will not be felt for GB traders, but NI traders will continue to need to apply Meursing codes to imports of specific types if the good is considered to be at risk of being further transported to the EU.</li>
<li>At the very least, this requires DIT policy and DDaT to retain some knowledge of the Meursing challenge, even if the majority of the UK will not be subject to the controls</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="application-of-a-meursing-code-in-detail-waffles-and-wafers">Application of a Meursing code in detail – Waffles and wafers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Let’s take “waffles and wafers - with a water content exceeding 10% by weight”, commodity code 1905320500.
<a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/93090892-4f58c880-f695-11ea-932f-23fcf0c80bb9.png" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61055197/93090892-4f58c880-f695-11ea-932f-23fcf0c80bb9.png" alt="image" /></a></li>
<li>The third country duty reads as follows:9.00% + EA MAX 20.7% + ADFM</li>
<li>This is a complex compound duty involving both a ceiling and a pair of Meursing-related placeholders. These placeholders come in three forms, which, in the EU are labelled:</li>
<li>EA – Agricultural component </li>
<li>ADFM – Additional duty on flour</li>
<li>ADSZ – Additional duty on sugar (not shown here, but the principle applies)</li>
<li>The labels are based on French and German abbreviations (élément agricole, farine / mehl; sucre / Zucker)</li>
<li>The next section shows the breakdown – and what traders have to do</li>

<li>The first thing to notice is that the Meursing placeholders have no duties assigned to them – it is not possible to assign duty amounts to these measure components; they operate as placeholders that are filled in only when traders declare the content of the various delicious ingredients.</li>
<li>The trader goes to (for example) the gov.uk URL below, enters the component %ages and then is eventually presented with a 4-digit code, such as 7364.</li>
<li>Duties are then assigned specifically against the Meursing additional code 7364, totally independent of the hundreds of commodities that are subject to them – this is unique in the tariff database, where duties are usually against combinations of commodity codes and additional codes - not with Meursings.</li>

<h2 id="implications-for-tariffs-project">Implications for Tariffs project</h2>
<ul>
<li>Although it is theoretically possible that the UK will need to manage Meursing additional codes and their associated duties in the future, it is highly unlikely</li>
<li>Recommendation would be that no interface functionality is constructed to allow for managing Meursing codes themselves, as it is hugely complex.</li>
<li>Theoretically, if we wanted to just change the duties associated with the Meursing additional codes, this is possible: it is a matter of assigning duties direct to an additional code, rather than to a combination of commodity codes and additional codes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="meursing-table-and-the-reduction-indicator">Meursing table and the reduction indicator</h2>
<ul>
<li>There is one Meursing table but multiple layers of tariffs assigned against it</li>
<li>The “reduction indicator” is assigned to the tariff measure on the commodity code and to the duty assigned to the additional code. The border system picks the indicator that matches to select the right duty.</li>
<li>In use with multiple preferential agreements that reference composite agrigoods.</li>
<li>Japan goes to town on the usage of reduction indicators, forcing the EU to change its Taric schema to accommodate another three reduction tables.</li>
<li>By the end of the implementation period, be aware of two facts:</li>
<li>we will have done away with the concept of Meursing codes in the UK, therefore the reduction indicator will be irrelevant</li>
<li>we will not have a trade agreement with Japan</li>
<li>BUT:</li>
<li>we will need to honour the NI protocol, meaning Meursings will apply to imports of at risk goods from RoW and GB to NI, meaning DIT and DDaT need to continue to be aware of their presence.</li>

<h3 id="type-8-a-b-c-anti-subsidy-anti-dumping-codes">Type 8, A, B, C – Anti-subsidy / anti-dumping codes</h3><p>A Trade Remedy is explained elsewhere, but the important thing to note is that, for the two types of trade remedy that are by some distance the most abundant, Anti-dumping duties and Anti-subsidy duties, the punitive import duties are set against specific exporting companies that are deemed to have acted unlawfully, not against entire countries.</p>
<p>Essentially, a company is proven to have been dumping1 its goods on an overseas market (e.g. the European Union or the United Kingdom), or to have been receiving unlawful state subsidy to undercut international competitors, and this activity is found to have been damaging businesses in those overseas nations. In such cases, the nation or bloc’s Trade Remedies body, such as our own Trade Remedies Authority, is entitled to investigate and impose punitive duties specifically against the companies that have been proven to have acted unlawfully.</p>
<p>In the case of Trade Remedies, the 4-digit additional code is set to represent the company from which the good is imported, or in some cases, a multitude of companies that have been found guilty of the same infraction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By way of example:
Code C316 refers to Bengang Steel Plates Co., Ltd (Benxi, Liaoning)
Code C333 refers to all of:
* Aeolus Tyre Co., Ltd;
* Aeolus Tyre (Taiyuan) Co., Ltd;
* Qingdao Yellow Sea Rubber Co., Ltd;
* Pirelli Tyre Co., Ltd
To create a punitive trade remedy duty against a the import of “flat rolled steel” from “Bengang Steel Plates”, you assign a 552 measure against commodity code 7225990092 and additional code C316.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the European Commission first set up the Taric database to cater for all trade eventualities, they were somewhat guilty of short-sightedness when it came to Trade Remedies.</p>
<p>They set up the additional type code ‘8’ in 1972 to deal with all future companies implicated in Trade Remedy cases. To be fair, this lasted until 1999, when the 1,000 possible permutations within the ‘8 ‘ type code (000 to 999) were exhausted. They then moved on to using ‘A’. In 2013, they moved on to ‘B’ and in ‘2015’ to ‘C’. By 2019, type ‘C’ was already half used up, so the expectation would be that they will move on to another additional code type within the next 2 years.</p>
<p>‘D’ is already used for dual use codes, albeit it is currently dormant.</p>
<p>In preparing for the multiple abortive stabs at EU Exit, the project team has (via scripts) created an additional set of additional code types (‘E’ and ‘F’) to cater for the inevitable expansion and deviation.</p>
<p>Additional codes, according to the Taric schema may be alphabetical, as well as numeric – alpha characters have never been used by the EU, but there is no reason why we could not use them in the future in the UK.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Additional codes used in Trade Remedies measures are essentially meaningless beyond Tariff – there is literally no reference against any international database of companies, nor any attempt to make the data set atomic and ‘cleansed’</p>
<p>You are likely to find multiple instances of the same company cropping up in the database on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>Be careful about the shenanigans that companies get up to evade punitive duties – most often by setting up subsidiaries in overseas nations with similar names: these are not the same company, nor the same additional code, but they may have very similar company names.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="additional-codes-cannot-be-applied-universally">Additional codes cannot be applied universally</h2><p>There is an additional many to many table within the tariff database that determines which additional code types can be used against which measure types. Currently there are 74 permutations of additional codes against measure types: there is little surprising about the alignment – e.g. you can only assign additional codes of type 8, A, B or C to measure types that are associated with Trade Remedies.</p>
