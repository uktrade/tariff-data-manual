Nation duties\n\n\n\n\nMFN - universal and the lowest common denominator\n\n\nUnderstanding the commodity code hierarchy \u0026 impact on MFNs\n\n\nErga Omnes\n\n\n\n\nAuthorised use (End use)\n\n\nWhat is authorised use?\n\n\nDetermining what goods are for ‘authorised use’\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the Most Favoured Nation principle?\n\n\nUnder the WTO agreements, countries cannot normally discriminate between their trading partners. Grant someone a special favour (such as a lower customs duty rate for one of their products) and you have to do the same for all other WTO members.\nMFN duties are those that are applied globally without favour or privilege.\n\nWhy ‘most-favoured’?\n\n\nThis sounds like a contradiction. It suggests special treatment, but in the WTO it actually means non-discrimination — treating virtually everyone equally. Each member treats all the other members equally as “most-favoured” trading partners.\nIf a country improves the benefits that it gives to one trading partner, it has to give the same “best” treatment to all the other WTO members so that they all remain “most-favoured”.\nThere are exceptions …\n\n\ncountries can set up a free trade agreement that applies only to goods traded within the group\nthey can give developing countries special access to their markets GSP.\na country can raise barriers against products that are considered to be traded unfairly from specific countries.\n\nBut the agreements only permit these exceptions under strict conditions.\nIn general, MFN means that every time a country lowers a trade barrier or opens up a market, it has to do so for the same goods or services from all its trading partners — whether rich or poor, weak or strong.\n\nMFN - universal and the lowest common denominator\n\nThe MFN is unique, inasmuch as there must be coverage of the entire tariff with one of two measure types (or both):\n\n\n103 (Third country duty)\n105 (Non preferential duty under end-use)\n\nThere are c. 24,500 commodity codes on the Tariff, of which c. 16,500 are declarable end-lines – every single one of these end-lines has an MFN duty against it\nIn a lot of cases, the MFN rate is 0%, but that 0% still needs to be actively set against the commodity.\nThe MFN is what will be charged unless the trader actively takes steps to take advantage of a more preferential rate, such as a tariff preference associated with a Free Trade Agreement or a quota.\nIt’s vital when we come to migrate data for the UK’s own MFN after the end of the Implementation Period that coverage of the commodity code base is complete (103s and 105s).\n\n\nUnderstanding the commodity code hierarchy \u0026 impact on MFNsThis is discussed in vastly more detail in the training guide on commodity codes, however it is useful to discuss with regard to MFN duties as well.\nBelow is a relatively shallow hierarchy of commodities, leading to an end-line of Natural Chilean sodium nitrate (3102500010).\n\nApart from the “section”, which is a pseudo-tier in the classification hierarchy, the MFN duty, and indeed any measure at all, cold be attached to any tier (i.e. the four listed beneath the screen grab – it will then inherit down to any child codes.\nErga Omnes\n\nErga Omnes is a Latin phrase which means “towards all” or “towards everyone”. In trade terms, Erga Omnes is the geographical area group which covers the entire world\nAll MFN duties (103s and 105s) are created against Erga Omnes, as are the majority of global import measures.\nErga Omnes has a geographical area ID of 1011.\nThere is an additional country group entitled “All third countries”, with ID 1008, which is used almost identically to Erga Omnes – they are practically interchangeable.\nThe only difference between the two is that 1011 contains the European Union as a country, whereas this is excluded from 1008.\nThere are no hard and fast rules about which should be used: Erga Omnes is used more for import measures and All third countries more for export measures, but this is by no means hard and fast.\n\nAuthorised use (End use)\nWhat is authorised use?Goods imported into the EU are regulated by a range of measures aimed at giving EU and UK businesses an equal footing with businesses elsewhere in the world. One of these is End-Use Relief (will be Authorised Use Relief).\nThis allows a reduced or zero rate of customs duty on some goods when used for specific purposes and within a set time period. End-Use Relief does not apply to VAT or excise duties.\nEnd-Use Relief is available on certain goods imported into the EU that are to be put to a specific use within the customs territory of EU. To be eligible for End-Use Relief, products must meet defined criteria and be identified in the Trade Tariff.\nEnd-use goods include:\n* shipwork goods\n* aircraft and parts\n* hydrocarbon oil\n* marine propulsion engines\n* military equipment\n* fish\n* cheese\n* casein (used in the cheese industry)\nDetermining what goods are for ‘authorised use’\n\nSadly, there is nothing so simple as a flag on a commodity code to define it is intended for authorised use purposes. There are commodity codes which are:\n\n\nexclusively provisioned to be used for authorised use\nunder certain circumstances available for authorised use\n\nThe simplest way to find a commodity that is designated solely for authorised use is to check for commodities that have measure type 105 (Non preferential duty under end-use) instead of 103 (Third country duty) against them. This is a small faction of the total number of commodities in the hierarchy.\nIn addition, the descriptions will have pointers to their end-use nature, e.g. containing words such as “for use in\" or “for the manufacture of” etc.\nAs always, there are exceptions: there are some commodities which have both a 103 and a 105 duty against them, as follows – there are just 5:\n\n\n        \n          \nCode\nDescription\n\n\n8802110010\nHelicopters of an unladen weight \u003c= 2.000 kg - For civil use\n\n\n8802120010\nHelicopters of an unladen weight \u003e 2.000 kg - For civil  use\n\n\n8802200010\nAeroplanes and other powered aircraft of an unladen weight \u003c= 2.000 kg (excl. helicopters and dirigibles) - For civil use\n\n\n8802300010\nAeroplanes and other powered aircraft of an unladen weight \u003e 2.000 kg but \u003c= 15.000 kg (excl. helicopters and dirigibles) - For civil use\n\n\n8802400010\nAeroplanes and other powered aircraft of an of an unladen weight \u003e 15.000 kg (excl. helicopters and dirigibles) - For civil use\n\n\n        \n      A trader is required to produce certificate N990 to take advantage of authorised use relief. This certificate should be present as a condition on all 105 duties (this also applies to other end-use measures). N990 is currently called “EUS - Authorisation for the use of end use procedure (Column 8c, Annex A of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/2446)”.\n","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-policy/most-favoured-nation-duties.html"},"11":{"title":"Measures","content":"Measures\n\n\nMeasures\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to measures\n\n\nEntering duties\n\n\nScreens – measures\n\n\nKey user needs\n\n\nKey business rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to measuresA measure is the fundamental raison d’être of the tariff – every piece of trade legislation that is intended to impact the trade of goods through a country’s borders must end up in a measure (or usually more than one).\nIf there is no measure, then the border systems will not react.\nA measure is an atomic unit: according to the Tariff, it is “the application, during a certain period, of an aspect of the Union tariff and commercial legislation to goods imported from a certain origin or exported to a certain destination” which sums it up quite nicely.\nA measure equates to a single line on the “Trade with the UK tool” - https://www.gov.uk/get-rules-tariffs-trade-with-uk\nA measure equates to a single line on the Trade Tariff Service (UKTT) - https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/sections\nBelow is a page from the UKTT for Asses (the animal) – each alternating grey \u0026 white line is a single measure. Some commodity codes can have hundreds of measures assigned to them.\n\nWhat a measure is not!\nThe tariff is a sea of intermingled terminologies – terms are used in different senses by different policy areas.\nFor instance, in Trade Remedies, the term ‘measure’ may be synonymous with ‘case’, e.g. an investigation launched by the TRA against multiple companies/countries. In this case, the ‘case’ will of followed through to its conclusion, result in a number of measures, a Tariff would refer to them – in the case of Trade Remedies, this could result in many thousands of Tariff measures.\nA measure is not an overarching policy or specific enactment of that policy: in Tariff terms, that is a regulation.\n\n\nMeasures and Regulations\n\n\n\nmeasure1\n\nMeasure\n\n\n\nmeasure2\n\nMeasure\n\n\n\nmeasure3\n\nMeasure\n\n\n\nmeasure4\n\nMeasure\n\n\n\nRegulation\n\nRegulation\n\n\n\nRegulation--measure1\n\n\n\n\nRegulation--measure2\n\n\n\n\nRegulation--measure3\n\n\n\n\nRegulation--measure4\n\n\n\nThe UK tariff is currently a combination of EU and national measures\nUntil the end of the Transition Period, we remain a part of the EU’s customs union. As a result of this, we do not get to determine our own trade policy: we cannot enforce our own trade agreements (though we can begin to negotiate them); we cannot impose punitive anti-dumping duties, nor can we decide our own MFN duties.\nBut we can manage certain aspects of the duties \u0026 regulatory controls that are applied to imports and exports.\nThe EU build all of their measures in their Taric application and then export them overnight for common application across all of the 28 member states (including us). This will continue until (at the earliest) Jan 1st 2021.\nMeanwhile, the UK (and all of the other members states) as permitted to manage some aspects that influence trade policy, namely:\n\n\nVAT\nExcise\nNational prohibitions and restrictions\n\n\nThe Tariff is a big relational database centred around the measure\nThere are training packs dedicated to each of these areas, so this is just a very brief introduction.\n\nMeasure types \u0026 responsibilities prior to the TP\n\n\nThere are c. 260 measure types in existence prior to the end of the Transition Period (TP).\nSome of these have not been used in some time and can be considered as dead, even if they are not formally terminated on the database.\nc. 80 of these are VAT and excise measures that DIT will never get involved in\nThere remain about 85 measure types that will crop up over the course of the next year and will need to be understood, even if some of these are going to be omitted from the UK tariff (in the first instance).\nThe measure types can be broadly broken in to the following groups, with the table to the right showing the division of responsibility between the EU and the member states, represented for the UK by HMRC.\nThese will evolve after the TP (Jan 2021).\n\n\nMeasure types \u0026 responsibilities post-TP\nAfter the Transition Period, there will be a great degree of similarity in the applicable trade measures. The UK is not revolutionising the types of trade measures that are to be imposed.\nThe major difference in responsibility will see the MTPO team in DIT’s Trade Policy Group replacing the role of the EU in co-ordinating and maintaining the measures that were previously seen as pan-European.\nThere are a number of other changes too, as per the notes column\nThese groups of measure types are detailed in subsequent pages.\n\nNational P\u0026R\nThere are c. 14 national prohibition and restriction type measures that are currently managed by the HMRC tariff management team. In the future, these will be translation into standard measures managed by the MTPO. After the Transition Period, there will be no differentiation between measures formerly provided by the EU and national P\u0026R.\n\n        \n          \nID\nDescription\nMeasure count (Jan 20)\nUK measure type\n\n\nAHC\nAnimal Health Certificate\n2433\n350\n\n\nAIL\nHealth and Safety Executive Import Licensing Firearms and Ammunition\n55\n351\n\n\nATT\nAttestation Document (horticulture and potatoes)\n12\n352\n\n\nCEX\nDCMS Open General Export Licence\n7\n353\n\n\nCOE\nHome Office Controlled Drugs (export)\n46\n354\n\n\nCOI\nHMI Conformity Certificate (fruit and veg) issued in UK\n30\n355\n\n\nCVD\nCommon Veterinary Entry Document (CVED)\n2176\n356\n\n\nEQC\nCertificate of Conformity\n34\n357\n\n\nHOP\nHome Office pre-cursor chemical authorisation\n12\n358\n\n\nHSE\nHealth and Safety Executive (imports)\n12\n359\n\n\nPHC\nPhytosanitary Certificate (import)\n174\n360\n\n\nPRE\nHome Office Pre-cursor chemicals\n86\n361\n\n\nPRT\nHome Office Controlled Drugs (import)\n405\n362\n\n\nQRC\nQuarantine Release Certificate\n78\n363\n\n\n        \n      The CVD measure type is a complete duplicate of measure type 410 (Veterinary control) applied in the Taric measures.\nMeasures of this type are being removed from the UK Tariff in Feb 2020.\nMeasures and geographical areas\nThe data model allows a single measure to be attached to a single geographical area.\nIn this context a geographical area can mean:\n\n\na single country (or region1)\na group of countries\n\nThe group of countries may be a formal trading bloc, like the EU or CARIFORUM (Caribbean Trading Nations)\nIn the geography is a group, then individual countries within that group may also be excluded.\nFor example, while Haiti is a part of CARIFORUM (both officially and in the Tariff), it is excluded from all preferential measures of the Caribbean EPA (Economic Partnership Agreement), as it has yet to ratify the treaty.\n\nMeasures and commodity codes\n\n\nA measure is applied to a single commodity code only\nWhile a trade instrument (FTA, import restriction etc.) may and is likely to cover multiple commodity codes, this results in the creation of many individual measures.\nThe Tariff database employs inheritance to apply measures – there are up to 13 tiers in the commodity code hierarchy.\nIn theory, a measure can be applied at any tier in that hierarchy and inherited down. In practice, measures are very rarely assigned at HS chapter (the first tier in the hierarchy).\nWhile this inheritance is great for accelerating the creation of measures, it brings complexity in terms of business rule adherence.\nA measure cannot exist in a hierarchy in the same context (i.e. same measure type, same comm code tree, same date period, same measure type etc.) more than once.\nSo there is no concept of applying a measure at a higher tier in the database and then having it superseded by a more granular exception in a lower tier – you need to be explicit when assigning measures.\nThus, if  commodity X has 10 children, 9 of which require a 0% duty and 1 of which requires a 50% duty, then you must assign the duties explicitly to all 10 commodities\nSee the commodity code training manual for more information, especially re: business processing rule ME32.\nA commodity code or goods nomenclature item is assigned to a measure via two fields, both of which point to the same data item (goods_nomenclature_item_id and goods_nomenclature_sid).\nWhile a commodity code is fully characterised also by its productline_suffix (in places misspelled as producline_suffix), all measures must be assigned to commodity codes with a productline_suffix of 80, therefore this data would be superfluous on the the measure table.\n\nMeasures and additional codes\nA measure can be assigned to a single additional code only.\nAs with commodity codes, there are multiple fields used to link the measure to the single additional code:\n* additional_code_type_id\n* additional_code_id\n* additional_code_sid\nUnlike commodity codes, there is no concept of inheritance with additional codes – the code is given meaning solely by the additional code type (single digit); the additional code ID (three digits) is essentially a meaningless sequentially sourced number.\nAn additional code is assigned to a measure for multiple reasons, which could potentially be extended in the future:\n* to reference a specific company which will be assigned anti-dumping or anti-subsidy duties\n* to reference the route of ingress into the Union (wheat \u0026 other cereals)\n* to reference product usage (e.g. pharmaceutical usage gets a reduced import duty)\n* to reference goods pillaged from Syria \u0026 Iraq\n* to reference the %age content of sugar, flour or milk fats/solids.\nSee the additional codes training manual for more information on why additional codes are used.\nMeasures and time periods\n\n\nLike most (but not all) objects on the tariff database, measures come with validity_start_date and validity_end_date fields.\nFor measures, validity start dates are mandatory, whereas validity end dates are optional and usually left blank.\nMeasure start dates usually coincide with the start dates of the regulations that engender them, though that is not always the case: the regulation also usually has no end date.\nA measure will have and end date when it is intended to be explicitly end-dated, e.g. a measure related to a quota, where a limited balance is available for a specific period of time, or agri measures which are intended to be updated on a metronomic basis, e.g. unit prices, if we choose to adopt these.\nEven though the Taric business processing rules document states that the measure start date under certain circumstances is optional, it is wrong.\nThe schema requires a measure start date in the format yyyy-mm-dd\n\nValidity start dates and end dates are treated differently in the Tariff.\n\n\nValidity start date means 00:00 at the start of the day\nValidity end date means 00:00 at the end of the day.\nTherefore a measure that starts on Jan 1st and also ends on Jan 1st lasts for a full 24 hours and not zero hours.\nThere is no concept of time in the tariff for ‘Taric’ measures, i.e. those that fit into the normal EU schema, which we are adopting.\nHowever, for VAT and excise, the concept of time has been introduced, as this is required to time changes with budget speeches.\n\nMeasures and regulations\nA measure is associated to two sets of regulations, depending on its status. These are referred to as follows:\nMeasure-generating regulations:\n\n\nThe measure-generating regulation is mandatory for all measures.\nThis is the regulation that gives measures their legal base. The reference to the measure-generating regulation is split into two fields\n\n\nmeasure_generating_regulation_role\nmeasure_generating_regulation_id\n\n\nJustification regulations:\n\n\nThe term “justification” regulation is short-hand for “justification for closing” – it is used to identify the legal base that causes the regulation to be terminated in the EU. The UK does not have a similar kind of legislative function – we will not be using the justification regulation as a way of formally auditing the closure of regulations. But there are business rules that make this piece of data critical.\nA justification regulation is not created when a measure is started unless an end-date is also supplied – however, if an end date is supplied, then the justification regulation is mandatory. If the end-date is not entered, then the justification regulation must not be supplied.\nThe justification regulation must be either:\n\n\nthe measure’s measure-generating regulation, or\na measure-generating regulation, valid on the day after the measure’s (explicit) end date.\n\nWhen we end-date measures in TAP, we always use the measure-generating regulation as the justification regulation.\n\nMeasures and footnotes\n\n\nIt is possible to apply footnotes to both commodity codes and to measures.\nAs with anything else associated to the measure, the footnote is inherited down to child comm codes – therefore if a measure with a footnote is assigned at HS chapter, then both the measure and the footnote are inherited down to all comm codes in that chapter.\nA footnote is connected to the measure by a linking table (many-to-many) called footnote_association_measures.\nFootnotes are linked to measures for the entirety of the measure’s duration – the association does not have its own start and end dates – which differs from footnotes’ association with commodity codes, which are dated.\n\n\nMeasures and duties\n\n\nDuties are applicable to some, but not all measures. If the measure type is set up with data on the “measure_component_applicable_code” field of “0” or “1”, then a component may / must be applied. If the value of this field is “2”, then the component is not permitted.\nExamples of where a duty is mandatory are 103 (Third country duty (MFN)) and 142 (Tariff preference)\nExamples of where a duty is not permitted are the majority of the prohibition and restriction measures.\nDuties may be held in one of two places:\n\n\ndirectly assigned to the measure under all circumstances\nconditionally assigned to the measure in certain conditions\n\n\nDirectly-assigned duties\n\n\nDirectly-assigned duties are assigned to measures via the measure_components table\nA duty (direct- or conditionally-assigned) is often made up of more than one component, which are sequenced in ascending order, according to their duty_expression ID\n\nConditionally-assigned duties\n\n\nConditionally-assigned duties are assigned to measures via the measure_condition_components table, via the measure_conditions table.\nThese state that a certain condition needs to be fulfilled for the duty to apply, e.g. a certain entry price or supply of a certificate.\nThese relationships are described in full in the measure components training manual.\n\nMeasure components and measure condition components\n\nMeasures, conditions and certificates\n\n\nA measure can be assigned any number of conditions. These are described in full in the measure conditions training manual, but are used to describe to the border systems:\n\n\nduties that apply under certain circumstances\nborder control restrictions that apply under certain circumstances), such as the imposition of requiring a certificate or another kind of document.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of conditions that can be assigned to a single measure, though the current max (Feb 2020) is 26 conditions.\nPlease see the detailed “measure conditions” guide for a full overview of conditions in all their different flavours.\n\n\nRelationship between measures and quotas\n\n\nWhile First Come, First Served (FCFS) quotas are entirely separate objects on the database, it is not possible to allow traders to declare against quotas unless there is a quota measure exposing its presence to the trader – all trade instruments that are to be executed in CHIEF or CDS need measures to make them work.\nSimilarly, licensed quotas are operated via measures, though they do not have the additional quota data structures associated with them that are used by FCFS quotas.\n\n\n\n\nThe quota structures are linked to the measures via the use of the ordernumber field. This field takes a 6-digit quota order number and is the same data that is managed in the quota_order_number_id field of the quota_order_number table and similar.\nFor licensed quotas, the data is also entered into this field as a 6-digit code, but always starts ”094”.\n\nModifying measures\n\n\nIn most cases, making a change to a measure is not actually a case of actually modifying that measure entity, nor the ancillary objects (such as conditions and components).\nMost fundamental changes to a measure are achieved by terminating the measure and replacing with an alternative from the date on which the change is scheduled to happen – otherwise, you run the risk of making changes to measures which have already been active and possibly declared against by traders: to change already live data, e.g. the commodity code or the applicable duties is simply not done.\nLet’s say the action were to change the measure type of a given measure such that it evolves from being a 551 (provisional anti-dumping duty) to being a 552, a final anti-dumping duty (known as definitive anti-dumping on the EU tariff). Though this is a required use case, it would never be a case of just updating the measure type of the existing measure.\nInstead:\n\n\nthe tariff manager would need to provide a date on which to make the change, which should be no earlier than tomorrow\nthe existing measure is terminated on the date before the supplied change date\na new measure, effectively a clone, is created starting on the change date, with the old measure type replaced with the new.\n\nThis applies equally to the measure-generating regulation, the geography to which the measure applies, the applicable duties and conditions.\nIn addition, changing fundamental details of the measure, such as the quota order number or the reduction indicator are to be achieved via replacing the measure.\nIf the user is wanting to modify the assigned footnotes, then there is no need to clone the measure: adding a footnote to the existing measure is fine.\n\nThe stopped flag\n\n\nThe stopped flag is set to ‘true’ when a regulation ends a measure using a specific function called ‘abrogation’.\nThis both sets the effective end date in the regulation and the stopped flag in the measures table.\nIn the UK we are not using this, however be aware that the stopped flag is mandatory.\nPlease always set the stopped flag to false in all cases.\n\n\nExplosion level\n\n\nWhile this is a field that pertains to the measure type and not the measure itself, it is worth bringing it up here. The explosion level field can formally take 5 values, as per the XSD to the right, however in practice, only the values “8” and “10” are used.\nThe explosion level indicates how far down the goods classification hierarchy a measure can be assigned and the explosion level corresponds to the significant digits in the comm code. Treating comm codes as being 5 pairs of 2 digits …\n11 12 13 10 00 – 8 significant digits (despite the 8th being a zero)\n11 12 13 14 00 – 8 significant digits\n11 12 13 14 10 – 10 significant digits (despite the 10th being a zero)\n11 12 13 14 15 – 10 significant digits\nMeasures of a measure type that is set to an explosion level of 8 cannot be assigned to the 3rd and 4th of the commodity codes above.\nMeasures of a measure type that is set to an explosion level of 10 can be assigned to literally any commodity code.\nThis impacts business rule ME88 (see below).\n\n\nThe reduction indicator\n\n\nThis field is used to apply preferential Meursing tables to measures.\nThe field is not mandatory and in most countries is set to null.\nAlternative values are 1 to 6, which specify the reduction level to be applied to Meursing placeholders. \nThis is discussed in the agricultural duties training manual.\n\n\nExport refunds\n\n\nThe export refund nomenclature was a specific nomenclature used for the refund on the export of some agricultural products. This nomenclature is composed of a CN code linked to a 4-digit code called “Export refund additional code”.\nThis has been abandoned since 2013, so the field export_refund_nomenclature_sid should be set to null in all cases.\n\nEntering dutiesDuty sentence deconstructor\n\n\nThe Ruby application had some usability issues in terms of entering duties. See the subsequent guide to components, which deals in the specifics of measure components, but essentially the tariff manager needs to know the measure components and potentially select multiple of these components from dropdowns.\nWhile this offers a decent route to ensure that no business rules are contravened, it is problematic in terms of screen space, especially for complex conditions, where multiple duties are dependent on those conditions.\nIn addition, it uses a lot of JavaScript, which is not great for accessibility.\nTherefore the approach was taken to prototype something simpler – the nattily named duty sentence deconstructor.\n\n\n\n\nThis tool is designed to allows you to copy and paste or type any kind of duty string in to a field and have it translated into an actual set of measure components, abided by all the Taric business rules (e.g. only ever using one duty expressions once against a measure).\nThe page is unconnected at the moment, but has tested well, both in terms of its usage by policy team members and in terms of translating strings to components.\nThe tool works via a combination of JavaScript (which is optional) and backend string replacement (in PHP, but easy to replicate in Python).\nThe tool differentiates between supplementary unit measure types and all others – supplementary units expect to receive only a unit and in extremis a measurement unit qualifier [KGM E (per 1,000), KGM C (net of drained weight) and KGM S (of sugar with a yield in white sugar of 92%) are used] very infrequently.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MFN measure for white chocolate is on of the more complex duties on the EU tariff. The UK is unlikely to use anything so complex, but must be able to handle similar duties, in case we revert to this level of complexity. The duty is as follows:\n\n\n9.10 % + 45.10 EUR / 100 kg\nMAX 18.90 % + 16.50 EUR / 100 kg\n\nIf you copy this into the Duty field, you get a translation of it into the 4 clauses (parts field) and from there into the 4 respective measure components\nMost important thing to note is that actually clauses 1, 3 and 4 are effectively the same duty expression – the tool has worked out not to repeat an existing duty expression, hence 01 becomes 04, which becomes 19, so as to not repeat and break business rule ME43.\nThe validity column to the right is just a check (adding 1, 2, 4 and 8 to make 15) that the expression is valid according to the criteria noted bottom left.\nThe PHP is rough and ready but should be easily interpretable for translation into Python and componentisation.\n\nScreens – measuresSearch for measures\n\n\n\nThe search screen is vastly cut down in comparison to the existing TAP measure search screen.\nThis is a) to save on development time and b) because much of the functionality has not proven to be particularly useful – the original project delivered the capability to search on anything.\nPerformance is a challenge on search results, as the data needs to be returned from multiple tables, especially re: duties and conditions, and especially where the SQL contains a LIKE clause.\nSearch should be against at least all of the criteria on the screen to the left.\nIn the case of commodity code and regulation, the operator dropdown should include both “is one of” and “starts with” to allow exact matches, stemmed matches and searches against multiple precise items (by request of the policy team).\nUse type ahead on measure type, geography and quota order number fields.\n\nMeasures search results\n\nSearch results screen is common across most data objects – with measures (and quotas), the most important point to note is that there is no left-hand side filter capability - there is no room, as there is so much data that need to be returned. Search results table must include:\n\n\nView of number of results returned (above and below table)\nLink to export the entire dataset (not just the current page) to CSV\nButton to work with selected measures (both above and below the table)\nTable in GDS table style, but with font size shrunk to 12 point to fit the requisite volume of data.\nTable headers with sort controls, as appropriate (no value in sorting on measure_sid, duties, exclusions, conditions, footnotes, status).\nTooltip controls on table headers where appropriate – on this form especially useful on the conditions column, which is complex\nFor the measure SID column, it must be possible to select all measures, for use in the “work with” functions\nFor each measure, click on the measure_sid column value to navigate to the specific measure\nClick on data in the regulation column to navigate to that regulation.\nClick on data in the type (measure type) column to navigate to that measure type.\nClick on data in the additional code column to navigate to that additional code.\nClick on data in the geography and exclusions column to navigate to that geography.\nClick on data in the QON (Quota order number) column to navigate to that quota order number.\nShow status as icon\nUnder table show paging – this screen grab has been doctored to show only 10 results: suggestion is 100 results per page for measures.\n\nDisplay of complex conditions\n\nThe data in the conditions column is potentially very complicated and needs to be represented on the search results form – especially with Trade Remedies, the duties may be held in the conditions and this is perhaps the critical piece of information being sought.\nThe colour coding is helpful in separating out the components of a condition, all of which are important to the processing of the data in CDS, Gems and Caesar\nFor each line in the conditions column, this is what is meant:\n\n\nblue – the condition code and sequence number\npurple – the reference price (import price greater than …)\nred – the required certificate\ngreen – the action code\nblack – the applicable duties\n\nNot all elements are likely to occur together – in fact the nature of conditions is such that there will either be a reference price or there will be a requirement for a certificate, not both, as per the example to the left. Taking the first row, against commodity 85 41 40 90 41 and additional code B845, the following data applies:\n\n\nCondition 1 of type A, which requires certificate D018, in which case the declared subheading is allowed\nCondition 2 of type A, which states that if no certificate is provided, then the declared subheading is not allowed (i.e. the counterpoint to condition 1)\nCondition 1 of type F, which states that if the net free at frontier price (import price) \u003e 0.35 EUR WAT, then apply the duty 0.000%\nCondition 2 of type F, which states that if the net free at frontier price (import price) \u003e 0.248 EUR WAT, then apply the difference between import price and duty up to 0.350%\nCondition 3 of type F, which states that if the net free at frontier price (import price) \u003e 0.0 EUR WAT, then apply the duty 31.300%\n\nExtreme conditions\n\nView of tooltips for columns that need explaining\n\n\nTwo examples of tooltips where the column data benefits from more explanation – the most important one here is the conditions tooltip, where there is potentially a lot of complex data (as per previous slide).\nYes, this uses colour to indicate meaning, therefore running into some challenge for colour-blind users, however it is not the only indicator of meaning.\n\n\nFootnotes column – can also get very busy\n\nThe image to the left shows the 99 footnotes that currently apply to the import of various dual use goods into the EU.\nThe import control team should eventually review the complexity of this and reduce, however it is unlikely to happen for day one.\nKey user needs\n        \n          \nAs a …\nI want to…\nSo that …\nNotes\n\n\nTariff   Manager\nview   a list of existing measures\nI   can select and decide the next appropriate actions to be performed.\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\ncreate   a new (single) measure\nI   can keep both the Tariff Application and the downstream border systems up to   date with the latest trade position.\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\ncreate   new measures in bulk\nI   can keep both the Tariff Application and the downstream border systems up to   date with the latest trade position.\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\nedit   the properties of an existing measure      -description     -start   date     -end   date     -duties     -geographical   areas     -etc.\nI   can update the changes imposed and also be sent to the relevant external   systems.\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\nterminate   an existing measure, either individually or in bulk\nthe   measure will not be imposed on the relevant external systems.\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\nhave   a workflow process\nAll   measure changes can be validated and approved before being sent to CDS.\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\nhave   a search filter\nI   can find the measures I need quickly.\nMust   Have\n\n\n        \n      Key business rules\n        \n          \n#\nRule\nNotes\n\n\nME1\nThe combination of measure type + geographical area +   goods nomenclature item id + additional code type + additional code + order   number + reduction indicator + start date must be unique.\nRequired – extremely high priority     This is actually an understatement of the business rule.   There must be no crossover in dates (start or end date) of measures that shar   the same context (as described by the fields to the left). It is more than   just the start date. This and ME32 can be handled together: develop ME32 and   ME1 falls into place.\n\n\nME2\nThe measure type must exist.\nRequired – low priority     Measure types will need to be selected from a dropdown   (typeahead), but this should be checked nonetheless\n\n\nME3\nThe validity period of the measure type must span the   validity period of the measure.\nRequired – low priority     Any date related business rule should be avoided by the   Tariff managers simply not end-dating things – there is no real need to   end-date a measure type, and this should be reasserted.\n\n\nME4\nThe geographical area must exist.\nRequired – low priority     As per the measure type, this should be avoided by   selecting from a list, however this should be checked.\n\n\nME5\nThe validity period of the geographical area must span the   validity period of the measure.\nRequired – low priority     As per the measure type check, this is required, but can   be avoided by not end-dating geographical areas (which is unnecessary).\n\n\nME6\nThe goods code must exist.\nRequired – high priority     Required – this should be checked on first entering the   commodity codes (goods code, commodity code, good nomenclature item id are   all synonymous)\n\n\nME7\nThe goods nomenclature code must be a product code; that   is, it may not be an intermediate line.\nRequired – high priority     This means that the commodity code must exist with a product   line suffix of “80” and not any other value which would reflect the fact that   the commodity is an intermediate heading and nothing more.\n\n\nME8\nThe validity period of the goods code must span the   validity period of the measure.\nRequired – high priority     This is one of the more critical rules – commodity   codes do start and end on a regular basis and there must be no commodity   codes that terminate before the end date of the assigned measure(s).     This applies equally to open-ended measures on   commodity codes that are end-dated. If a commodity code is being end-dated,   and there will be a requirement to do so, then any measures against that   commodity code must also be terminated.\n\n\nME88\nThe level of the goods code, if present, cannot exceed the   explosion level of the measure type.\nRequired – medium priority     This is primarily aimed at export control measures,   which are set at 8-digits rather than at the 10-digits that are reserved for   import measure types. Explosion level is set against the measure type, and   not the measure itself. If the user attempts to assign a measure to a   10-digit commodity when the explosion level is set to 8, then ME88 will be   triggered (see page earlier in deck re: explosion level).\n\n\nME16\nIntegrating a measure with an additional code when an   equivalent or overlapping measures without additional code already exists and   vice-versa, should be forbidden.\nRequired – high priority     This mostly impacts trade remedies, but also EU   additional code types (most of which will not carry forward), such as route   of ingress additional codes (see separate guide). What this means is that, if   there are measures set up against a combination of a commodity code and an   additional code, then it is not permitted to set up a measure against just   that commodity code (without the additional code).     For instance – a Trade Remedy is in place, where this   has involved creating an anti-dumping measure against a commodity code   (0102030405) and an additional code (C233 – Shanghai Industries). The duty   has been set to 25% (punitive specifically against Shanghai Industries).     It must not be possible to set up a measure for the   same time period, of the same type against just comm code 0102030405 with no   additional code. Border systems do not like ambiguity. Instead, the   additional codes presented for that context must cover the full universe of   options – e.g. residual (All other companies A999, B999, C999) codes are set   up for Trade Remedies.\n\n\nME115\nThe validity period of the referenced additional code must   span the validity period of the measure\nRequired – medium priority     As with all similar rules, this needs to be checked but   should rarely if ever come up, as Tariff Managers should not be end-dating   additional codes.\n\n\nME25\nIf the measure’s end date is specified (implicitly or   explicitly) then the start date of the measure must be less than or equal to   the end date.\nRequired – low priority     Should be checked as soon as the dates are entered into   the application. End date will in almost all circumstances by empty (Null)   for measures.\n\n\nME32\nThere may be no overlap in time with other measure   occurrences with a goods code in the same nomenclature hierarchy which   references the same measure type, geo area, order number, additional code and   reduction indicator. This rule is not applicable for Meursing additional   codes.\nRequired – extremely high priority     This is the mother of all business rules and the one   that is likely to trip DDaT and Tariff Managers up more than any other. This   is an extension of the previously described ME1 to all commodity codes in the   upward hierarchy and all commodity codes in the downward hierarchy.     Therefore it is critical that the development team   works out a way of identifying a commodity’s hierarchy from the available   data. There is no concept of parent / child relationship in the database,   rather a list of sequential numbers and indents which infer the hierarchy.     This business rule is detailed on the next pages and in   the section on import control measures. There are 40+ import control   measures, all of which do broadly one of two things: prohibit goods entirely   from being traded, or require that certain provisions are taken (e.g.   documentation). There are so many measure types precisely to avoid ME32.     See next page for details…\n\n\n        \n      ME32 and Jams, fruit jellies, marmalades\n\n\n\nAs a tariff manager, I have been asked to create a new measure for ERGA OMNES of type “Import control” at level 4 “with a sugar content exceeding 30% by weight” – \nThere is already a measure of type “Import control” at level 8 “Fruit purees obtained by sieving then brought to the boil in a vacuum, the texture and chemical composition of which have not been changed by the heat treatment”\nME32 says no\nI can either rejig the measures in the entire hierarchy to suit to new measure OR …\nI can invent a new measure type “Import control for sieved fruit puree” … which is what the EU has done, and which we will also need to do in the future.\n\n[have not included from page 60-88]\n[have not included create new measures section in this section]\n\n","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-data-structures/measures.html"},"12":{"title":"Certificates","content":"Certificates\n\n\nCertificates\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to certificates\n\n\nUser needs - certificates\n\n\nBusiness rules - certificates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to certificatesWhat are certificates?\nThe certificates tables in TARIC-based applications store all of the certificates, licences and other conditions that are referenced via measure conditions in order to make the import (or export) of a good conditional on the provision of some entity.\nThe sole purpose of certificates in this system is to associate them to measures via measure conditions – on their own, they no value and are not exposed to traders via any other means.\nThis entity is usually a physical or digital document of some description (e.g. a license or official certificate), but it may also be a non-paper condition - the term “certificate” to label the table is definitely more constrictive than the actual subject matter.\nA good example of the ‘non-document’ condition is “Y037 - Goods exempted from the prohibition – biathlon equipment’ where the condition references a property of the good being imported, and not an accompanying document.\nThese oddities are typically linked to measures using the measure_condition_code “Y”. Please read the instruction guide on measure conditions for a detailed insight.\n\nWhat certificates are not\n\n\nA certificate is not a representation of the actual document itself\nOur database stores only a certificate code (4 digits) and a description of that code\nThere is no instruction on where to find that document (if the certificate represents an actual document), there is no link to a URL nor guidance on how to complete the certificate\nThis could be construed as a flaw in the public-facing aspect of the certification model.\nThere is a feeling of ‘so what’ when confronted with the need for a certificate – the interaction may favour traders that know certification inside out and the regulations that underpin it, but for entryists, the concept can be bewildering\nDIT may consider extending the model to allow more information than just a code and basic description to be stored against the certificate, bearing in mind that the majority of such documents or other entities would likely be owned by Defra or on occasion HMRC\n\nStructure of certificates \u0026 certificate types\n\n\n\nMuch like footnotes and additional codes, certificates are made up of a type code and then a specific code, which, when concatenated, form the unique code of the certificate.\nFor example, the footnote C656 is constructed of a type code © and a specific certificate code (656) – the entire certificate is known as C656.\nCertificate type codes are always 1 digit in length and can be any alphanumeric character (upper case). Historically the alphabetical certificate type codes have been used for EU-wide certificates: the numeric certificate type codes are used for national measures.\nCertificate codes typically use numeric IDs, running from 001 to 999 can be reused across multiple certificate type codes. While the schema also allows for alphabetical certificate codes, these are rarely used: there are 11 instances of certificate codes using alpha instead of numeric digits.\nCertificate codes must be 3 digits in length.\n\nOverview of existing certificate type codes\n\n        \n          \nCode\nDescription\nMeasure count\n\n\n9\nNational   Document\n3694\n\n\nA\nCertificate   of authenticity\n26180\n\n\nC\nOther   certificates\n70129\n\n\nD\nAnti-dumping/countervailing   document\n47982\n\n\nE\nExport   certificate/licence/document from country of origin\n2220\n\n\nH\nHANDI,   LOOMS certificate\n1048\n\n\nI\nSurveillance   certificate/licence/ document issued by one of the Member States\n4648\n\n\nK\nTariff   quota\n988\n\n\nL\nImport   certificate/licence/document\n62408\n\n\nN\nUN/EDIFACT   certificates\n18877\n\n\nP\nIngredients\n4935\n\n\nR\nExport   refunds\n791\n\n\nU\nProofs   of origin\n37088\n\n\nX\nExport   licence\n25051\n\n\nY\nParticular   provisions\n112304\n\n\nZ\nMore   certificates\n18886\n\n\n        \n      \n\nThe table lists all of the certificate code types and their frequency of use on measures in the existing tariff (since the beginning of time).\nThose that are greyed out have not been used in the last 5 years.\nThe certificate type codes are somewhat meaningless – as you can see, two of the most frequently used code types are C (Other certificates) and Y (Particular provisions) – these are catch-alls for the large proportion of condition needs.\n\nUse of certificate code types since 2015\n\n        \n          \n2015\n31\n707\n1,693\n3,290\n1\n\n988\n843\n583\n54\n1,820\n10,010\n\n\n2016\n39\n710\n10,608\n4,365\n6\n46\n800\n884\n574\n182\n8,806\n27,020\n\n\n2017\n1,862\n922\n6,699\n11,177\n46\n24\n375\n3,399\n3,436\n343\n19,911\n48,194\n\n\n2018\n580\n715\n994\n11,488\n10\n55\n37\n967\n1,073\n195\n3,786\n19,900\n\n\n2019\n768\n710\n5,854\n6,355\n37\n73\n27\n4,200\n888\n1,271\n10,508\n30,691\n\n\n2020\n\n710\n525\n174\n93\n\n2\n992\n840\n8\n1,520\n4,864\n\n\n2021\n\n204\n\n\n\n\n\n38\n\n\n8\n250\n\n\nGrand   Total\n3,280\n4,678\n26,373\n36,849\n193\n198\n2,229\n11,323\n7,394\n2,053\n46,359\n140,929\n\n\n        \n      \nJust because there are a lot of instances of applications of certificates to measure conditions does not mean there is an abundance of certificates\nIn this period since 2015, 36k+ D (Anti-dumping) type certificates have been used, but this entails the application of just 7 unique certificates.\nWho owns certificates?\n\n\nIt is anticipated that there will be numerous owners for certificates across government: Defra, the RPA, ECJU, Trade Remedies Authority for example\nIn the lead-up to the previous three abortive No Deal EU Exits, the question of migrating certification to a standard that differed from the EU’s was not mentioned – all certification would have remained exactly as-is, for two reasons:\n\n\nthis was the best way to prevent additional ‘accidental’ friction at the border\nthe expertise and knowledge in government to make informed changes to certification was not there\n\nAfter the implementation period, the expectation is that standards will diverge to a degree and therefore certification will also diverge, however for Jan 1st 2021, the expectation (that needs to be tested) is that the EU certification will be carried forward as-is.\nPlease see the document on data migration for more information.\n\nManaging certificate types in TAP\n[may be moved to a different section so I have not included this section]\nUser needs -

The measure types describe to the border systems how to execute some kind of action on the trade in question (e.g. charge a duty / require a document).\nWhile the data associated with a measure type is a pretty good explainer of what the measure is intended to do, there is a significant amount of work to be done by HMRC to make the measure behave as intended.\n\n\n\n\nThis is even more important when one considers the continuing role that CHIEF will play during the dual running of the two border systems - CHIEF is unable to extend its measure type capability without programming: at least CDS can be configured to extend its measure type list.\n\n\nAny changes to measures, additions of new measures will need to be agreed by HMRC in advance – their function cannot fully be described in Taric: see anomaly of measure type 696 (used in steel safeguards) below.\nRegulation groups, measure types and Box 36 of the SAD form\n\n\nIn the regulation training manual, we mentioned the need for regulations to be assigned to the right regulation groups, because of the correlation required between the regulation group and what the trader enters in Box 36 on the SAD form.\nWell the measure type falls into the same bracket – the measure types have to be actively correlated to regulation group IDs by HMRC in CDS.\nTherefore, HMRC need to be involved in measure type creation.\n\n\nMeasure types \u0026 responsibilities prior to the IP\n\n\nThere are c. 260 measure types in existence prior to the end of the implementation period (IP).\nSome of these have not been used in some time and can be considered as dead, even if they are not formally terminated on the database.\nc. 80 of these are VAT and excise measures that DIT will never get involved in.\nThere remain about 100 measure types that will crop up over the course of the next year and will need to be understood, even if some of these are going to be omitted from the UK tariff (at least in the first instance).\nThe measures that we need to manage can be broadly broken in to the following groups, with the table to the right showing the division of responsibility between the EU and the member states, represented for the UK by HMRC.\nThese will evolve after the IP (Jan 2021).\n\n\n        \n          \nResponsibility\nInstrument\n\n\nThe EU\nThird country (MFN) duties     Tariff preferences in Trade Agreements     Quotas in Trade Agreements     WTO quotas     Autonomous tariff quotas     Trade Remedies \u0026 safeguards     Duty suspensions     Agricultural safeguards     Supplementary units     Credibility checks     Surveillance measures     Common prohibitions and restrictions\n\n\nThe   member states (HMRC for the UK)\nNational   prohibitions and restrictions     VAT     Excise\n\n\n        \n      Measure types \u0026 responsibilities post-IP\n\n\nAfter the IP, there will be a great degree of similarity in the applicable trade measures.\nThe major difference in responsibility will see the MTPO team in DIT’s Trade Policy Group replacing the role of the EU in co-ordinating and maintaining the measures that were previously seen as pan-European.\nThere are a number of other changes too, as per the notes column\nThese groups of measure types are detailed in subsequent pages.\n\n\nMeasure type series\n\n\nEach measure is associated with a single measure type.\nEach measure type is in turn associated with a single measure type series, in which additional properties of the measure type and its behaviour are stored, and the application logic for the measure types is sequenced.\nThe measure type series are put in place to permit multiple means of overlaying measure types (and hence duties) via combination and exclusion.\n\n\n\n\nIf modifying measure types were considered dangerous, then modifying measure type series is much more dangerous – it is highly recommended that any work that DIT to represent measure types series is to present a read-only view: there should be no capability to manage the measure type series, as the impact is potentially so damaging.\n\n\nMeasure types series - measure type combination field\n\n\nThe measure type combination field determines how many measure types of a given type series can be applied on a trader’s declaration at any given time to the same context.\nThere are just two valid options:\n\n\n        \n          \nOption\nDescription\n\n\n0\nOnly   1 measure at export and 1 at import from the series\n\n\n1\nAll   measure types in the series to be considered\n\n\n        \n      What this does not mean\n\n\nIf measure type combination is set to 0, this does not mean that Tariff managers can only set up a single measure type from each measure types series in the same context.\n\nWhat this does mean\n\n\nThis does mean that a trader can only take advantage of one measure types from any given series (if combination set to 0).\n\nFor example:\n\n\nThese commodities (8802110010, 8802120010, 8802200010, 8802300010, 8802400010) all have both 103 (Third country duty) and 105 (Non-preferential duty under end-use) applied to the same context1.\nIt is quite possible for a trade agreement to feature both a tariff preference and a preferential quota on the same context (commodity code), but the trader can only call on one of these, not both.\nThe measure type series identifies how different measures are applied alongside or overlaid.\nFor example, you cannot apply multiple measures from the same series (the trader must choose), but multiple measures from different series can be overlaid.\nHence, anti-dumping duties (series D) are overlaid on top of MFN duties (series C) - the to coexist, are additive and do not require selection by the trader.\n\nExisting measure type series\n\n\n\nThis table is important in understanding how Taric-based border systems apply the measures that DIT has supplied.\nFirstly, the sequence matters – the alphabetical sequence of measure types series is the sequence in which CDS will look to implement the measures.\nTherefore, any complete prohibitions are dealt with first, via measures of type series A (Importation and/or exportation prohibited). If there is a complete prohibition that applies to the specific circumstances of the trade (e.g. the combination of commodity and origin), then that’s that – the trade cannot continue – working out anything else / checking certificates etc is of zero value.\nIf there is no complete prohibition on the trade, then the next step is to work out if the trader has the necessary conditions in place, including certification or licensing, to allow the trade to pass (type series B). Again, if the necessary documentation or other conditions are not met, there calculating the import duty is somewhat academic.\nThese two measure type series apply equally to imports / exports.\n\n\nThirdly, after application of the prohibitions and restrictions, measure type series C is checked (applicable duty)\n\n\nSeries C contains the MFN duties, tariff preferences, all the quotas and all the suspensions – the trader picks one (actively)\nSeries D contains the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties – of these, if there are multiple that apply to a given context (for example both an anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duty on the same code for the same company), then they both apply: the trader does not get to choose the lower.\nSeries E and F contain Meursing duties, then we get to …\nSeries J is the countervailing charge series (officially) – the countervailing charge measure in this group is no longer used (since 2005), leaving just 695 (additional duties) and 696 (additional duties (safeguard)). Safeguards are the exception that prove the rule with regard to applicability duties according to measure type series sequence – this is discussed on the following pages.\nSeries M features measure types associated with agricultural safeguards, not duties (e.g. the SIV, Unit price)\nSkipping N and O (non-duty-related), the next duty-bearing series are VAT and excise (series P and Q), which are applied over and above import duties.\nFinally, series S contains the additional duties required by the agricultural safeguards re: chicken and other poultry goods, which are applied over and above any standard duty from series C.\n\nMeasure types per measure type series\n\n        \n          \nSeries\nDescription\nMeasures\n#\n\n\nA\nImportation   and/or exportation prohibited\n277, 278, 481,   485\n3\n\n\nB\nEntry   into free circulation or exportation subject to conditions\n410, 420, 464, 465, 467, 473, 474, 475, 476,   477, 478,   479, 482, 483, 705,   706, 707, 708, 709, 710, 711, 712, 713, 714, 715, 716, 717, 718, 719, 722,   724, 725, 728, 730, 735, 740, 745, 746, 747, 748, 749, 750, 751, 755, 760,   761,   770, 771, 772, 773, 774, AHC, AIL, ATT, CEX, CHM, COE, COI, CVD, DPO, ECM, EHC, EQC,   EWP, HOP, HSE, IWP, PHC, PRE, PRT, QRC,   SFS\n58\n\n\nC\nApplicable   duty\n103, 105, 106, 112, 115, 117,   119, 122, 123, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145,   146, 147\n13\n\n\nD\nAnti-dumping   or countervailing duties\n551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 561,   562, 564, 565, 566, 570\n11\n\n\nE\nLevies,   export refunds and other agricultural amounts\n674, 680, 681, 683, 684, 685, 686,   687, 688\n1\n\n\nF\nAdditional   duty on sugar, flour\n672, 673\n2\n\n\nJ\nCountervailing   charge\n690, 695, 696\n2\n\n\nM\nUnit   price, standard import value, representative price (poultry, sugar)\n488, 489, 490\n3\n\n\nN\nPosterior   surveillance\n430, 431,   440, 442,   445, 447,   450, 455, 456, 457, 460, 461, 462, 463, 468, 469, 470, 471, 472\n4\n\n\nO\nSupplementary   unit\n109, 110\n2\n\n\nP\nVAT   (HMRC responsibility)\n305, VTA, VTE, VTS, VTZ\n5\n\n\nQ\nExcises   (HMRC responsibility)\n306, DAA, DAB, DAC, DAE, DAI,   DBA, DBB, DBC, DBE, DBI, DCA, DCC, DCE, DCH, DDA, DDB, DDC, DDD, DDE, DDF,   DDG, DDJ, DEA, DFA, DFB, DFC, DGC, DHA, DHC, DHE, EAA, EAE, EBA, EBB, EBE,   EBJ, EDA, EDB, EDE, EDJ, EEA, EEF, EFA, EFJ, EGA, EGB, EGJ, EHI, EIA, EIB,   EIC, EID, EIE, EIJ, EXA, EXB, EXC, EXD, FAA, FAE, FAI, FBC, FBG, LAA, LAE,   LBA, LBB, LBE, LBJ, LDA, LEA, LEF, LFA, LGJ\n♾\n\n\nS\nSupplementary   amount\n651, 652, 653, 654,   655, 656, 657, 658\n4\n\n\n        \n      This table illustrates, per measure series, the measure types that have not been actively end-dated. Bold indicates measures for which there is at last one measure in Jan 2020 (plus the provisional anti-dumping and countervailing duties, which happen to have no measures currently, but remain active).\nContext - what does this mean?\n\n\nFirst thing to say – this is a useful term invented by the project team: it is not a Taric term, but is a handy short hand for what it actually means\nHere is a Taric sentence that helps to explain context: this is taken from Taric Business Processing rule ME1:\n\n\n\n\nNo two measures that match on all of these fields can coexist – according to this rule, if just one field differs, then a second measure can be inserted.\nIn fact, the stated rule is not as strict as reality – if there is any crossover of period of application (start \u0026 end dates), then the measures will clash.\nIn addition – conflict checking must also apply all the way up and down a commodity code hierarchy – this is explained below in the pages re: ME32\n\n\nThe measure type 696 anomaly\n\n\nMeasure type 696 is the measure used to impose safeguards on imports of steel from multiple countries around the world, in an attempt to stabilise the flow of steel goods coming into the Union as a result of the USA’s imposition of similar safeguards: the upset to world trade flows caused such a glut of cheep steel to land on EU shores, that the EU had no option other than to follow suit.\nSafeguards are made up of two elements: a 25% safeguard additional duty, and a non-preferential quota, which essentially waives the safeguard.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the additive rules of thumb re: measure type series, it is unclear by what mechanism the quota (type 122) can cancel out the additional duties (safeguard).\nThe understanding is that this must have been achieved via some custom configuration in the border systems.\n\nMeasure type fields\n        \n          \nField\n\n\n\nmeasure.type.id\nThe unique ID of the measure type, as referenced in the   measure. This is always exactly 3 digits long. For measure types sourced from   the EU, this is a numeric string; for UK national measures (VAT, excise and   national P\u0026R, this is a 3-digit alphabetical string).\n\n\nvalidity.start.date\nThe date from which a measure type is valid\n\n\nvalidity.end.date\nThe date on which a measure type is terminated –   suggestion is that this gets left as NULL unless absolutely required to   change\n\n\ntrade.movement.code\nDetermines if the measure type is intended to be attached   to an import or export (or both). Possible values are:          0        Import – majority of measure types concern import, as the tariff        primarily deals with import      1        Export – most of these are export controls (e.g. sanctions)      2        Import/export – there are very few measure types which are applicable to        both import and export\n\n\norigin.dest.code\nThis field is an exact duplicate of trade.movement.code   (above), but it is required in Taric. Also, ignore the definition of the   options that are listed in the Taric Elements guide: it is wrong – there are   three options that are possible, as above:          0        Import      1        Export      2        Import/export – (omitted in the Elements guide)\n\n\npriority.code\nThis appears to be a redundant field, as literally all   EU-sourced measure types have a priority.code of “1” – if we are managing   measure types in the Tariff Application, we should use always set the value   to 1. There are national measure types (set in CHIEF) that have a   priority.code of 5.\n\n\nmeasure.component.applicable.code\nDetermines if measure components (or measure condition   components) can be attached to this measure type – things like 3rd country   duty (103) and preferential tariff quota (143) require measure components,   whereas things like import / export controls must not have them (e.g.   Veterinary control 410).     This rule needs to be checked when creating measures\n\n\norder.number.capture.code\nDetermines whether a quota order number should be assigned   to a measure of this type: there are two options:     1 Mandatory – e.g. 122 (Non preferential quota), 143   (Preferential quota)     2 Not permitted – e.g. 142 (Tariff preference)     This rule needs to be checked when creating measures\n\n\nmeasure.explosion.level\nThis field determines how far down the hierarchy a measure   can be ‘exploded’ according to the less than helpful elements guide.   Essentially this means that the number of digits in the hierarchy to which   measures of this type can be assigned.     Always set this to 10 for import measures and to 8 for   export measures (in declaring exports, traders are only required to declare   at 8 digit level).\n\n\nmeasure.type.series.id\nThe ID of the series – single alphabetical character; acts   as foreign key into the measure type series table, where additional   properties that relate to the execution of the measure types is set.\n\n\n        \n      Logical view of measure typesPrimary duty-bearing measures – logical layout\n\nTrade remedy-related measures – logical layout\n\nSAD guidance \u0026 credibility checks, monitoring\n\nAgri measures\n\n\nWhy there are so many import control measures … ME32\n\n\n“There may be no overlap in time with other measure occurrences with a goods code in the same nomenclature hierarchy which references the same measure type, geo area, order number, additional code and reduction indicator. This rule is not applicable for Meursing additional codes.”\n\nJams, fruit jellies, marmalades …\n\n\n\nAs a tariff manager, I have been asked to create a new measure for ERGA OMNES of type “Import control” at level 4 “with a sugar content exceeding 30% by weight” – \nThere is already a measure of type “Import control” at level 8 “Fruit purees obtained by sieving then brought to the boil in a vacuum, the texture and chemical composition of which have not been changed by the heat treatment”\nME32 says no\nI can either rejig the measures in the entire hierarchy to suit to new measure OR …\nI can invent a new measure type “Import control for sieved fruit puree” … which is what the EU has done, and which we will also need to do in the future.\n\nRelationship of measure types to additional code types\n\nRelationship of measure types to additional code types\nThe joining table additional_code_type_measure_types has been created to manage the limitations as to which additional codes can be applied to which measure types.\nIt is not the case that additional codes can be assigned to measures of all types – these relationships have to be curated\nThe Northern Ireland protocol is looking to bring in a revolutionary way of managing commodity codes, which may see UK commodity codes being represented as additional codes – if this is the case, then the case for this tool grows.\nLists of all existing relationships of the following page.\n\n\n\nDatabase\n\n\n\nMeasure Types\n\nMeasure Types\n\nmeasure_type_id\n\nint\n\nPK\n\nvalidity_start_date\n\ndate\n\n\nvalidity_end_date\n\ndate\n\n\ntrade_movement_code\n\nint\n\n\npriority_code\n\nint\n\n\nmeasure_component_applicability_code\n\nint\n\n\norigin_dest_code\n\nint\n\n\norder_number_capture_code\n\nint\n\n\nmeasure_explosion_level\n\nint\n\n\nmeasure_type_series_id\n\nint\n\nFK\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Code Type Measure Types\n\nAdditional Code Type Measure Types\n\nmeasure_type_id\n\nint\n\nFK\n\nadditional_code_type_id\n\nint\n\nFK\n\nvalidity_start_date\n\ndate\n\n\nvalidity_end_date\n\ndate\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Code Type Measure Types:e-\u003eMeasure Types:w\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Code Types\n\nAdditional Code Types\n\nadditional_code_type_id\n\nint\n\nPK\n\nvalidity_start_date\n\ndate\n\n\nvalidity_end_date\n\ndate\n\n\napplication_code\n\nint\n\n\nmeursing_table_plan_id\n\nint\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Code Type Measure Types:e-\u003eAdditional Code Types:w\n\n\n\n\n\nmeursing_table_plan_id Note\n\n\n\nAlways null in UK tariff\n\n\n\nmeursing_table_plan_id Note-\u003eAdditional Code Types:meursing_table_plan_id_name\n\n\n\nAdditional codes cannot be applied universally …\nThere is an additional many to many table within the tariff database that determines which additional code types can be used against which measure types.

Suspensions\n\n\nQuota Suspensions\n\n\n\n\nManaging suspension periods on TAP\n\n\nKey user needs\n\n\nKey business rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBackground to Quotas\n\n\nA quota provides an opportunity for an importer to import goods at a rate that is lower than the prevailing MFN (or preferential rate) until the specified volume of goods has run out (or exhausted).\nOnce the volume has exhausted, the quota is no longer available and the out-of-quota-rate is then payable.\nA quota can be managed via two regimes, as follows: First Come First Served (FCFS) and Licensed.\n\n\n\n\nQuota suspensions are applicable only to First Come First Serve quotas\n\nWhat are quota suspensions?\n\n\nQuota suspensions are functions that are enabled in legal text to allow for First Come First Serve quotas to be made effectively unavailable to traders for a given period of time, for a number of reasons – these reasons are typically written into the initial legal text, such that there is no requirement to legislate to bring in the suspension.\nSome typical reasons are as follows:\n\n\nThe administrative costs of running the quota mean that there is no value in doing so while the MFN rate is equal to or lower than the in-quota rate – for example, the image to the right is a fragment of EU regulation “2016/1219, amending Council Regulation (EC) No 499/96 as regards Union tariff quotas for certain fish and fishery products originating in Iceland” – the footnote explains why the quota is suspended from 15 Feb to 15 June.\ne.g. for fishing quotas, a quota is applicable only while overall catch volumes do not exceed a given amount.\n\n\n\nLogical model of a quota suspension\n\n\n\nUsing the herrings example from the previous page, quota 09.0792 runs annually from January 1st to December 31st and is applied to commodity code 0303510000.\nThe MFN is 15.00% all year round, except for the period between Feb 15th and June 15th, where it is 0.00% (tariff free)\nThe EU has chosen to suspend the quota for the period where the MFN is zero, as there is no value in running a quota when there is no material gain to be made for the trader in applying for quota usage during that period.\n\nWhen is a quota not a quota?\nA quota suspension can be thought of as an antidote to a quota; a nullification of its effects; during the period of the suspension, it is as if the quota is not there; a trader cannot request an allocation against that quota and it is invisible on the Trade Tariff Service, as follows:\nFor 1st July 2019, after the suspension, the quota is visible https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/commodities/0303510010?currency=EUR\u0026day=1\u0026month=7\u0026year=2019#import\n\nFor 1st March, during the suspension, the quota is hiddenhttps://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/commodities/0303510010?currency=EUR\u0026day=1\u0026month=7\u0026year=2019#import\nIt is important to note however that there a many ways to skin a cat: in this example, the EU has also made the quota measures last from 16th June to 14th Feb and not all year long.\nSimplified quotas data model (as applies to suspension periods)\n\nA quota order number is made up of many quota definition periods\nWhen setting up quotas, it’s important to understand that a single quota order number record is made up of many definition periods: these periods may be of any length (no longer than a year, with the most typical lengths being annual and quarterly, as well as a number of custom periods, especially re: agricultural goods \u0026 seasonal marketing periods).\n\nQuota suspension data object in detail\nThe quota suspension object is not one of the more complex objects in the database: there are few fields, in fact there are only three that you need to actively define.\n\n\n        \n          \nField\nDescription\n\n\nquota_suspension_period_sid\nUnique   identifier, automatically generated by the application when a new suspension   period is created – you do no create this yourself\n\n\nquota_definition_sid\nThe   quota definition to which the suspension is to be attached – you do not need   to enter the ID of the definition: you select it from a list (as will be   demonstrated)\n\n\nsuspension_start_date\nThe   start date of the suspension blocking period – i.e. 00:00 at the start of the   chosen day\n\n\nsuspension_end_date\nThe   end date of the suspension blocking period – i.e. 00:00 at the end of the   chosen day\n\n\ndescription\nAn   optional field, up to 500 characters in length, that helps to define the   suspension and the reasons for it: the EU has been deeply unhelpful /   non-descriptive in its suspension descriptions and we may choose to be more   expressive post-EU Exit\n\n\n        \n      \nA suspension period must fit within a definition period\nThe critical point is that a quota suspension is defined against a quota definition period: the suspension period MUST NOT straddle the boundary of the definition – in the rare occasion you need to straddle a boundary, create 2 suspension\n\nDates on TAP\n\n\nA reminder from the main training manual that there is a peculiarity that should be surfaced with regard to dates on TAP.\nMost objects on the database are bookended by start dates and end dates.\nFor measures, quota definitions, geographical areas and most other data objects, these dates are referred to in the database as “validity start and end dates”.\nQuota suspensions periods and blocking periods are also bookended, but they break the otherwise universal rule in terms of naming fields, choosing instead:\n\n\nsuspension_start_date and suspension_end_date\nblocking_start_date and blocking_end_date\n\nFor all of these date ranges, the same rules apply, namely:\n\n\nwe work on dates and not times: a single day is the smallest unit of time\nfor start dates, the actual ‘start’ is defined as being 00:00 at the start of the day\nfor end dates, the actual ‘end’ is defined as being 00:00 at the end of the day\ntherefore, if the start and end dates of a given object are identical, this equates to a whole 24 hours and not to 0 hours\nTHIS CANNOT BE STRESSED ENOUGH, and is critical to the use of suspension periods.\n\n\nManaging suspension periods on TAP[Not yet sure if this will go in a different section so I have omitted

rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to measure components\n\nMeasure components basically equate to duties applied to tariff measures.\nNot all tariff measures have duties associated with them – for instance measures of type 103, 142 or 143 (third country duty, tariff preference and preferential tariff rate quota) require duties, but for others, e.g. 277 Import prohibition, measure components are not permitted.\nThe screen grab to the right shows the duties / measure component column on the UK Trade Tariff service.\n\n\nTypes of duty\nBroadly speaking, there are three kinds of duties that can be applied to a measure:\n\n\nAd valorem duty, for example 0.00% or 3.60% (a percentage additional duty applied to the import duty of the goods)\nSpecific duty, for example 4.200 EUR / KGM or 110.00 EUR / LTR (an import duty that is dependent on the weight / volume of goods being imported and not just the import price)\nCompound duty – a combination of the above ad valorem and compound types, e.g. 3.60% + 110 EUR / LTR\n\nIn addition, there are ‘conjunctions’ which join multiple ‘clauses’ within the duty sentence, as follows:\nMin (down to a minimum of …)\nMax (up to a maximum of …)\nFourthly, there are duty placeholders that are used to manage Meursing code inserts for complex agri-foods – though this is not a policy that the UK intends to take forward after the implementation period, it is worth bearing this in mind – this is explained in a separate document “Meursing codes”\nFinally, there are is a concept called “Supplementary units” which is dealt with in the ”Measurements” document but referenced here.\nIntroduction to measure components\n* A measure component is the term used in tariff management to describe the elements that make up a tariff duty.\n* The example to the right shows a screen grab of a page from the Trade Tariff Service for ‘white chocolate’\n* This is a deliberately extreme example, as the duties applied to the import of white chocolate into the European Union illustrate a number of the concepts behind management of duties and measure components.\n* The full duty applicable to the import of white chocolate (1704903000) is as follows:\n9.10 % + 45.10 EUR / 100 kg MAX 18.90 % + 16.50 EUR / 100 kg\n* This is a ferociously complex duty that is a pair of compound duties joined together by a MAX conjunction\n* The next slide illustrates how this is broken into multiple measure components.\n\nBreaking down a duty string\n\n\ngraph “Measures” {\n  rankdir=LR\n  node [shape=box]\nmeasure1 [label=Measure component]\n  measure2 [label=Measure component]\n  measure3 [label=Measure component]\n  measure4 [label=Measure component]\n“Measure” – measure1\n  “Measure” – measure2\n  “Measure” – measure3\n  “Measure” – measure4\n}\nIntroduction to duty expressions\n\n\n\nThe table lists all of the possible duty expressions that can be used.\nThe duty expression indicates to the border system how to treat the values that are attributed to the other columns in the measure_component table.\nAlthough there are 32 listed, very few of these are used on a regular basis. The ones that are used regularly are highlighted in yellow.\nThose highlighted in green are massively prevalent right now in the EU tariff, but are expected to fall away in the UK tariff after the implementation period (Meursing codes).\nThe numbers of the duty expression IDs are essentially arbitrary, but they imbue meaning that is shared across Taric-based systems.\nThey are immutable – we cannot change or append to these and we cannot delete any unless we want to cause significant heartache for the CDS team in HMRC.\n\nDuty expression sequencing \u0026 duality\n\n\nGrouping duty expressions\n\n        \n          \nRequirement\nUse duty expression …\n\n\nTo   add an ad valorem duty or specific duties …\n01,   04, 19 and 20\n\n\nTo   add an ad valorem duty or specific duties after a MAX clause\n17   and 35\n\n\nTo   add an ad valorem duty or specific duties after a MIN clause\n15\n\n\nTo   add a Meursing placeholder …\n12,   14, 21, 25, 27 and 29\n\n\nTo   add a supplementary unit\n99\n\n\n        \n      And that’s pretty much it. It is not up to you to choose which of the grouped duty expressions to use:\n* use 01 in all occasions for an ad valorem duty or specific duties …\n* unless there is a compound duty, in which case use 01 followed by 04\n* etc.\nWhite chocolate’s duty string contains four elements, as per the measure components:\n\n\n9.10 % - a simple ad valorem (duty expression 01)\n45.10 EUR / 100 kg – a specific duty (duty expression 04)\nMAX 18.90 % - a simple ad valorem (again), introduced by a Max conjunction (duty expression 17)\n16.50 EUR / 100 kg – a second specific duty (duty expression 19)\n\nOn the previous slide, we describe the duty expressions 01, 04 and 19 (and 20) as being functionally identical, however, they display differently – this is solely down to the other values in the table row.\n\nSimply speaking, follow these rules of thumb for standard duty expressions (excluding Meursing and supplementary units):\n\n\nif there is a value set in the monetary unit code column, then we are looking at a specific duty; if there is no value in this column then this is an ad valorem duty. This is why the duty expression description is ”% or amount”\nthe monetary unit will always be EUR (Euros)\nif the monetary unit is specified, then the measurement unit must also be specified: you cannot have a specific duty that requires the importer to pay €x per … \nif the measurement unit is specified, you may also apply a qualifier – this is not mandated and is in fact quite uncommon, but is used to specify measurement units such as “kilogramme net weight” or ”kilogramme gross weight” etc.\nThe measurement unit qualifiers can only be applied to certain pre-mandated measurement units.\n\nAbout measurement units\n\n\n\nThe tables above identify the measurement units that can be used.\nAs with many of the Taric objects, there is a lot of historical content that has not been used for some time.\nThe yellow highlighted cells are those measurement units that have been used in the past 10 years\nIt may be appropriate to hide the less recently used measurement units from tariff managers.\nThe IDs of these units are not always especially self-explanatory\nPay special attention to NAR, which is very commonly used. Presumably, this is a German abbreviation (e.g. Nummer Artikeln), but it means number of items. To confuse even more, on the Trade Tariff Service and on the EU Taric Consultation, this is referred to as “p/s” (which stands for pièces / Stücke (items in FR / DE). Finally number of items is often referred to as “heads”, when referencing livestock, e.g. cattle especially in quotas. You have been warned.\n\nAbout measurement unit qualifiers\n\n\n\nThe table to above identifies the measurement unit qualifiers that can be used. Those highlighted in yellow are those that have been used since Jan 2021.\nThe table below is used to identify which qualifiers can be used alongside which measurement codes. It’s vital that the TAP interface does not allow any combination of unit and qualifier not specified in the measurements table.\n\n\n        \n          \nMeasurement unit\nDescription\nMeasurement unit qualifier\nDescription\n\n\nASV\n%vol\nX\nHectolitre\n\n\nDTN\nHectokilogram\nE\nnet of drained weight\n\n\nDTN\nHectokilogram\nF\nof common wheat\n\n\nDTN\nHectokilogram\nG\nGross\n\n\nDTN\nHectokilogram\nL\nof live weight\n\n\nDTN\nHectokilogram\nM\nnet of dry matter\n\n\nDTN\nHectokilogram\nR\nof the standard quality\n\n\nDTN\nHectokilogram\nS\nof sugar with a yield in white sugar of 92%\n\n\nDTN\nHectokilogram\nZ\nper 1% by weight of sucrose\n\n\nKGM\nKilogram\nA\nTotal alcohol\n\n\nKGM\nKilogram\nE\nnet of drained weight\n\n\nKGM\nKilogram\nG\nGross\n\n\nKGM\nKilogram\nP\nof lactic matter\n\n\nKGM\nKilogram\nS\nof sugar with a yield in white sugar of 92%\n\n\nKGM\nKilogram\nT\nof dry lactic matter\n\n\nLTR\nLitre\nA\nTotal alcohol\n\n\nMTQ\nCubic meter\nC\n1 000\n\n\nNAR\nNumber of items\nB\nper flask\n\n\nTNE\nTonne\nE\nnet of drained weight\n\n\nTNE\nTonne\nI\nof biodiesel content\n\n\nTNE\nTonne\nJ\nof fuel content (usually in form of tallow, stearin, paraffin wax or   other waxes, including the wick)\n\n\nTNE\nTonne\nK\nof bioethanol content\n\n\nTNE\nTonne\nM\nnet of dry matter\n\n\nTNE\nTonne\nR\nof the standard quality\n\n\nTNE\nTonne\nZ\nper 1% by weight of sucrose\n\n\n        \n      Managing duties in TAP II[may be moved to a different section so have not included it yet]\nSupplementary unitsOn most occasions, when a trader is declaring their goods for import, they are mandated to declare the weight of their goods in kilogrammes (KGM).\nHowever, there are times where this is not the measurement required – common measurement types might be “number of items” for livestock, volume in litres for liquid items, “number of pairs” for socks etc. (really).\nOn such an occasion the trader is asked to complete box 41 on the SAD form (below) – the trader must enter the numeric value and the supplementary unit, e.g. 247 items (NAR) or 15,000 litres of pure alcohol (LPA).\n\nThe supplementary units are the same measurement units as described previously in this document. They are set up in the Tariff as follows – they are measures like any other:\nStep 1 – create a measure of type 109 or 110\n\n\nuse 109 typically as this is a x-purpose measure type used for both imports and exports\ntype 110 is used solely for imports\nthere is also a type 111 for exports: it is never used \n\nStep 2 – create a measure component\n\n\nuse 99 as the duty expression ID\nset the measurement unit code field to whichever measurement unit is to be used\nyou may also set a measurement qualifier unit, however this is extremely rare.\n\nMeasure component data structures\n\nMeasure condition components\nMeasure conditions may be attached to conditions instead of to measures themselves.\nIt is important that one does not double up and apply measure condition components AND measure components - this will break the business processing rules of Taric and fail to load on CDS.\nThe data structures concerning measure condition components are almost identical to those for measure components – the only real difference being that they are attached to the condition and not the measure itself.\nKey business processing rules\n        \n          \n#\nDescription\nNotes\n\n\nME40\nIf the flag “duty expression” on measure type is   “mandatory” then at least one measure component or measure   condition component record must be specified.    If the flag is set “not permitted” then no measure component or   measure condition component must exist.    Measure components and measure condition components are mutually exclusive. A   measure can have either components or condition components (if the ‘duty   expression’ flag is ‘mandatory’ or ‘optional’) but not both.\nRequired     This describes the fact that measures of certain types   MUST have components (duties) assigned to them, whereas others must not.     Please note the sub-clause also – if the value of the   field “Component applicable” is set to 1 (Mandatory) on a measure type, then   when the measure is created, there must be either measure components or   measure condition components assigned to the measure, but not both. CDS will   generate errors if either of these conditions are not met.\n\n\nME41\nThe referenced duty expression must exist.\nRequired     There is a specified list of duty expressions that can be   used in TAP / CDS.

We must not   use these.\n\n\nME43\nThe same duty expression can only be used once with the   same measure.\nRequired     Even if an expression that (in English) reads the same needs   to be used more than once in a measure, we must use a different expression   ID, never the same one twice.\n\n\nME45\nIf the flag “amount” on duty expression is   “mandatory” then an amount must be specified. If the flag is set   “not permitted” then no amount may be entered.\nRequired     The three possible values for this field on the   duty_expressions table are:     0 - Permitted     1 - Mandatory     2 - Not permitted     These values must be observed – By the way, we should not   allows users to modify the data associated with duty expressions, as the   knock on impact will be too significant.\n\n\n#\nDescription\nNotes\n\n\nME46\nIf the flag “monetary unit” on duty expression   is “mandatory” then a monetary unit must be specified.

The table below identifies the condition codes that are currently in use (12.01.20) in the EU Tariff. This is not all possible condition codes – there are a number that have been used in the past that are no longer in use. The highlighted rows are those that are in use most frequently, and, importantly are likely to be used most frequently in the UK tariff.\n\nMeasure conditions and condition components\n\n\n\nGoing back to the list of condition codes, there are a number of condition codes which make reference to a minimum or maximum import price, otherwise known as a reference price (or trigger price). These are highlighted in blue to the left.\nThe most frequent \u0026 volatile example of this in the EU tariff is condition type V – this is used to manage the Entry Price System (detailed later).\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, and the other condition codes that follow the same pattern, the fields in the measure condition code table (that start condition_) represent the trigger price: the fields in the measure_condition_components table represent the duties that will be payable a a result of the trigger condition having been met.\nExample overleaf …\n\nConditions and condition components – cherry tomatoes\nIf there is a complex mechanism to be demonstrated, it is a fair bet that it can be highlighted using cherry tomatoes, which attract most complexities - tomatoes plus another c. 30 commodities are subject (in the EU) to the Entry Price System.\n\nIn the diagram above (taken from the Trade Tariff Service), the measure condition trigger fields are highlighted in the red marquee.\nThe payable duty amounts are highlighted in blue – if the trigger condition is met (in this case if a consignment of tomatoes comes into the country at a price lower than or equal to a given threshold (trigger price), then the duty charged will be increased.\nBoiling it down, there are only really 2 condition mechanics\n\n        \n          \nDoes the trader have the right documentation?\n\n\n\nA\nPresentation   of an anti-dumping/countervailing document\n\n\nB\nPresentation   of a certificate/licence/document\n\n\nC\nPresentation   of a certificate/licence/document\n\n\nH\nPresentation   of a certificate/licence/document\n\n\nQ\nPresentation   of an endorsed certificate/licence\n\n\nY\nOther   conditions\n\n\nZ\nPresentation   of more than one certificate\n\n\n        \n      \n        \n          \nIs the price higher than a reference price?\n\n\n\nE\nThe   quantity or the price per unit declared, as appropriate, is equal or less   than the specified maximum, or presentation of the required document\n\n\nI\nThe   quantity or the price per unit declared, as appropriate, is equal or less   than the specified maximum, or presentation of the required document\n\n\nF\nThe   net free at frontier price before duty must be equal to or greater than the   minimum price (see components)\n\n\nL\nCIF   price must be higher than the minimum price (see components)\n\n\nM\nDeclared   price must be equal to or greater than the minimum price/reference price (see   components)\n\n\nR\nRatio   “net weight/supplementary unit” is equal to or higher than the   condition amount\n\n\nU\nRatio   “declared value/supplementary unit” should be higher than the   condition amount\n\n\nV\nImport   price must be equal to or greater than the entry price (see components)\n\n\n        \n      The different varieties of condition code are really just variations on two themes:\n\n\nis documentation right?\nis the price \u003e x?\n\nAction codes\n\nIf the condition code identifies the type of condition that has to be met, then the action code identifies the type of action that will be taken in response.\nThe table to the right lists the action codes that can be associated with a condition\nThe action code is mandatory – there is no value in a condition if there is no action to be taken on the back of it.\nThe list to the right is initially daunting – it is simplified when one observes that most action codes have a positive / negative variant: most action codes come in pairs\n\n\n        \n          \nID\nDescription\n\n\n01\nApply the amount of the action (see components)\n\n\n02\nApply the difference between the amount of the action (see components) and the price at import\n\n\n03\nApply the difference between the amount of the action (see components) and CIF price\n\n\n04\nThe entry into free circulation is not allowed\n\n\n05\nExport is not allowed\n\n\n06\nImport is not allowed\n\n\n07\nMeasure not applicable\n\n\n08\nDeclared subheading not allowed\n\n\n09\nImport/export not allowed after control\n\n\n10\nDeclaration to be corrected -

smoked aquatic invertebrates other than crustaceans and molluscs, whether or not cooked before or during the smoking process; flours, meals and pellets of aquatic invertebrates other than crustaceans and molluscs, fit for human consumption)against the EU (measure_sid 3566626)\nIn this case, the conditions are aligned against 2 condition codes:\n\n\nwithin condition code B and E respectively, any of the positive conditions will result in an acceptance of the trade.\nat least one condition needs to be fulfilled within each of the two condition code groups.\n\nThe intellectual knowledge of certification is a huge challenge in DIT, Defra and HMG as a whole - over the implementation period, significant effort in DIT and Defra should be expended in looking to understand certification.\n\n\nDetailed overview of condition codesCondition code A\n\n\n\nThis condition code is used to modify the circumstances of an anti-dumping or anti-subsidy duty depending on the conditions stated.\nThere are three scenarios in which this condition code is used, two of which have 2 related (and opposite action codes)\n\n\nScenario 1 – apply conditional duties depending on supply of document\nScenario 2 – determine if the trade can go ahead\nScenario 3 - determining applicability of exemption/reduction of the anti-dumping duty\n\n\nScenario 1 – apply conditional duties depending on supply of document\n\n\nThis is by far the most common application of conditional duties for trade remedy-related measures\nThe applicable duty can be conditional on the supply of a document: if the document is supplied then the duty is reduced\nThis scenario is executed by:\n\n\nsetting multiple (usually two) measure conditions with condition code A\nthen assigning action code 01, which states ”Apply the amount of the action”\nand to each condition then assigning an applicable duty\n\nThe documents used in the EU, presumably to be followed in the UK are as follows:\n\n\nD005 - Commercial invoice within the framework of undertakings\nD008 - Invoice with a signed declaration\nD017 - Commercial invoice within the framework of undertakings and Export Undertaking Certificate\nD018 - Invoice for transactions which are not exempted from countervailing/anti-dumping duties\n\n\nScenario 2 – determine if the trade can go ahead at all\n\n\nFeatures a pair of action codes which are always supplied together and are opposites of each other\n\n\n08 - Declared subheading not allowed\nThe trade will be rejected in CDS\nThis is always associated with no document being specified, therefore not presented with the trade\n28 - Declared subheading allowed\nThis is always associated with a document being specified, therefore presented with the trade and hence, the trade being permitted\n\nThere is only one certificate that has been used in conjunction with this condition code / action code permutation\n\n\nD020 - Commercial invoice and mill certificate as defined in Regulation 2015/1953\n\nThis scenario is not currently in use, but it has been used in the past\n\nScenario 3 – determining applicability of exemption/reduction of the anti-dumping duty\n\n\nAs with scenario 2, this features a pair of conditions with complementing action codes that are always found together\nThough not completely defunct, this is used only three times in current measures by the EU\nThe two action codes are:\n\n\n34 - Apply exemption/reduction of the anti-dumping duty\n14 - The exemption/reduction of the anti-dumping duty is not applicable\n\nThis basically means that the antidumping duty will be waived entirely or reduced according to the legislation. There are no conditional duties set however, therefore it is not 100% clear where the duty calculation will get its raw data from\nThe conditions should be applied in the sequence 34 then 14, i.e. positive followed by negative\nThere is only one current certificate in use that is used with this condition code / action code combination\n\n\nD008 - Invoice with a signed declaration\n\n\n\n\nConditions B, C and H are identical in meaning\nC and H are used when multiple condition sets using the same mechanic need to be applied to the same measure.\n\nCondition codes B, C \u0026 H\n\n\n\nCodes B, C and H require a certificate or other document to be presented in order for the requirement to be fulfilled.\nCondition codes C \u0026 H are identical to condition code B, and there is no overt reason as to why C / H might be used instead of B – they are however sometimes used alongside code B.\nCommodity code 8418690091 provides the answer as to why there are two types of condition that are ostensibly identical, i.e. there is a desire to apply multiple conditions sets to the same measure (in this case Import control of fluorinated greenhouse gases).\nIf just B had been used, it would not have been possible to apply the AND logic of the two condition groups.\nH is used only 41 times (Jan 2020); C is used c. 5,000 times whereas B is vastly more prevalent (c. 24,000 occurrences).\n\n\nCondition code E\n\n\n\nThis condition code is a combination of a quantitative restriction plus a documentation requirement, i.e. a trade will be allowed provided the volume of goods is lower than the defined threshold weight (or other unit), or a document is provided that permits the trade in a larger volume of goods.\nThe criteria that define these two conditions are set in the measure condition data.\n\n\nCondition code I\n\n\n\nThese condition codes are currently used uniquely with measure types 751 and 755 (import and export control of waste)\nThey are functionally identical to condition code E (see above).\nType I is only ever used in conjunction with type E to present a send condition set of the same type, never on its own\n\n\nCondition code F\n\n\n\nThese conditions allow duties to be charged against imported goods subject to Trade Remedies (Anti dumping or anti subsidy duties) that are dependent upon the unit price of the import.\nThis is significantly less commonly used than condition code A, which is also used to apply conditional logic to the trade of a good subject to an AD / AS duty, but remains an option for the TRA: there are 119 such conditions against 17,000 + of type A.\nIn the example to the right on measure 3571830 on commodity 2933610000 (melamine), there are two F-type conditions, which are dependent on the import price: the duties are set accordingly.\nWhat these conditions say is:\n\n\nif the goods is imported at a price of higher than €1153 per tonne, then apply zero additional punitive duty (condition 1)\nBUT if the import of the good is at a lower price, apply the difference between the import price and the punitive duty\n\nThis essentially sets a minimum import \n\n\nCondition code L\n\n\n\nThis is currently used only 30 times and is always applied to measures of type 652 - Additional duty based on cif price\nThis measure type is used in managing a complex agricultural duty called “Representative prices for chicken”, which in the EU tariff is applied to certain poultry products that are being traded from Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Thailand – the most aggressive of chicken traders.\nThe UK is not going to be taking on this policy, unless plans change between now and the end of 2020.\nThe policy is far too complex to describe here, but is described in detail in the general training manual.\n\n*Condition code M *\n\n\n\nCondition code M is used in two circumstances:\n\n\nThe first circumstance is the in managing EU supplied credibility checks of type:\n430 Control of particulars of the declaration (suspicious value/net weight or value/supplementary unit)\n483 Declaration of subheading submitted to restrictions (value)\n\nA credibility check is a mechanism that is employed in a border system to attempt to reduce errors in declarations by enforcing a check on (for example) the weight versus item count ratio of a declaration.\n430 and 483 are measures (along with 431) that are used by the EU to ensure that discrepancies are avoided.\nThe EU provides these across the whole of the EU because they are trying to ensure consistency and reduce errors (that they have to fix for all 28 member states).\nAfter EU Exit, the UK will provide its own credibility checks – the EU’s measures will be terminated\nIn reality, the EU’s credibility checks are a small subset of the overall number of checks that are carried out. CHIEF and CDS are replete with many UK-specific credibility checks as well. In the future, these will all be managed by HMRC, not by DIT MTPO, therefore are out of scope for DIT (albeit there is nothing to prevent TAP from creating these).\nThe second circumstance will continue after EU Exit, as it deals with Trade Remedies. The existing conditions of this type are against measure type ID 552 Definitive anti-dumping duty, but there is no reason why this would not also be assigned to measure types 551, 553 and 554.\nThis follows a similar pattern to other threshold-based commodities previously noted\nThere are currently (Jan 2020) 84 instances of condition code M.\nIn the examples to the right, there are two conditions which behave more or less the same as condition type F, where the applicable punitive duty is dependent the declared price [F depends on net free at frontier price before duty].\n\n\nCondition code Q\n\n\n\nCondition type Q is used in all cases where a measure is put in place to represent a licensed quota. And in all cases it refers to the single license Y100 (Special entries on the import licence AGRIM). It is used in measures of type:\n\n\n122  Non preferential tariff quota\n123  Non preferential tariff quota under end-use\n142  Tariff preference\n143  Preferential tariff quota\n\nIt is only used for licensed quotas; it is never used for FCFS quotas.\n\n\nCondition code R\n\n\n\nAs per scenario 1 for condition code M, this is used to apply conditions to credibility checks to ensure that the weight ‘looks right’ against the number of declared goods. The supplementary unit identifies what additional unit beyond the KGM weight must be supplied by the trader on declaring their import.\nAgain, as per condition code M, the UK will be abandoning the practise of managing credibility checks in the Taric file after EU Exit.\n\nCondition code U\n\n\n\nAs per scenario 1 for condition codes M \u0026 R, this is used to apply conditions to credibility checks to ensure that the declared value ‘looks right’ against the number of declared goods.\nThe supplementary unit identifies what additional unit beyond the KGM weight must be supplied by the trader on declaring their import.\nAs per condition codes M \u0026 R, the UK will be abandoning the practise of managing credibility checks in the Taric file after EU Exit.\n\nCondition code V – The Entry price System\n\n\nThe Entry Price System (EPS) is a complex mechanism to apply tiered duties to 31 agricultural products, primarily fruit.\nThe EPS is described in detail elsewhere, so this page will not go into that much detail, especially as the UK will be abandoning the Entry Price System. It supports growers of (primarily) citrus fruits in Southern Europe: the UK’s less sunny climes do not lend themselves to industrial-scale citriculture.\n\n\n\n\nThe screen above is captured from the third country duty for cherry tomatoes – this shows the EPS in action.\nThe duties that are applicable depend on the import price: the cheaper the import, the more expensive the duty\nThe purpose of this is to protect domestic growers in s. Europe from influxes of very cheap goods\n\nCondition code V\n\nThe data for EPS-related measures is as per the example to the right – just one row (marquee below).\n\nIn the example above, each row is a price threshold: if the import price falls below a given threshold, then the duty from the row below is charged.\n\nThis is, as its name suggests a catch all that can be used to manage effectively any condition not specifically covered by the other condition codes. In practice, this seems to have been used in the past by the EU for managing certificates, much in the vein of conditions with code B, C or H. But the real reason for using this is for non-specific conditions that are not associated with a specific document.\nThese miscellaneous conditions are linked to in much the same way that certificates are referenced, using the certificate type code and certificate code fields. Here are a few examples of conditions that are referenced by condition code Y. None of these are documents per se: they reference properties of goods or activities undertaken by traders outside of the core declaration flow.\nFor example:\n* Y019  Request for preferential treatment for Iceland\n* Y021  Request for EEA preferential treatment\n* Y034  Derogation from export prohibition by virtue of Article 4.1 of Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1509\n* Y037  Goods exempted from the prohibition – biathlon equipment\nNone of the conditions linked to via the condition code ‘Y’ utilise the price threshold fields.\nCondition code Z\n\nCondition code Z is used solely on national P \u0026 R measures currently, though it is by no means a stipulation that this has to be so. Indeed, all the national P \u0026 R will become homogenised with the measures inherited from the EU after EU Exit – though the management of measures to support the NI Protocol may influence the specific approach.\nThese are the measure types where Z is used:\n\n\nATT   Attestation Document (horticulture and potatoes)\nCEX   DCMS Open General Export Licence\nCOE   Home Office Controlled Drugs (export)\nCOI   HMI Conformity Certificate (fruit and veg) issued in UK\nEQC   Certificate of Conformity\nHOP   Home Office pre-cursor chemical authorisation\nPRE   Home Office Pre-cursor chemicals\nPRT   Home Office Controlled Drugs (import)\n\nThere is no reason why this condition code should be used in preference to B, C or H. Indeed there are occasions where the Z type is used, but only one positive condition is included, which seems to make the condition type pretty redundant (e.g. with EQC measures).\nThe advice to tariff managers would be to always use condition code B, then C then H before resorting to Z.\nKey business processing rules\n        \n          \n#\nRule\nNotes\n\n\nME53\nThe referenced measure condition must exist.\nRequired   This applies when assigning conditions components to   conditions A measure obvs has to be in existence too for a measure condition   to be generated in the first place.\n\n\nME54\nThe validity period of the referenced measure condition   must span the validity period of the measure.\nNot required - disregard   As far as we can see, this is an erroneous business rule:   the measure condition table does not have a start and end date field. The   condition adopts the start and end dates of the parent measure. Similarly,   there are no start and end dates associated with a measure condition   component (or for that matter a measure component). They all adopt the date   constraints of the parent measure.\n\n\nME55\nA measure condition refers to a measure condition or to a condition   + certificate or to a condition + amount specifications.\nDisregard   This has been written so vaguely that there are no rules   to be gleaned from it\n\n\nME56\nThe referenced certificate must exist.\nRequired   A certificate must exist before being assigned to a   condition – match must be made on the 2 clustered primary key fields of   certificate type code and certificate code\n\n\nME57\nThe validity period of the referenced certificate must   span the validity period of the measure.\nRequired   The optimal way for us to handle this is to NEVER expire   certificates – there is literally no need. However the validity start dates   and end dates of the measure and the certificate need to be checked. See note   at the foot of this document as to how null end dates have been dealt with in   terms of comparing extents – to reduce code\n\n\nME58\nThe same certificate can only be referenced once by the   same measure and the same condition type.\nRequired   There should never be a requirement to apply a certificate   more than once, but it needs to be checked. Again – use the 2 pronged cluster   primary key.\n\n\nME59\nThe referenced action code must exist.\nDebatable   The measure action table should remain fixed – by making   any modifications to this table, we are creating a lot of work for downstream   systems which need to be adjusted to cater for the change (CDS, Gems,   Caesar).\n\n\nME60\nThe referenced monetary unit must exist.\nRequired    Conditions are put in place to respond either to the   provision of some sort of document / license or to respond to a minimum   threshold import price – if the latter then there is a requirement to specify   a valid monetary unit, which is always likely to be GBP.\n\n\nME61\nThe validity period of the referenced monetary unit must   span the validity period of the measure.\nRequired - debatable   The unit will always be GBP or EUR – all we need to do is   to ensure that the units are not end-dated\n\n\nME61\nThe validity period of the referenced monetary unit must   span the validity period of the measure.\nRequired - debatable   The unit will always be GBP or EUR – all we need to do   is to ensure that the units are not end-dated\n\n\nME62\nThe combination measurement unit + measurement unit   qualifier must exist.\nRequired   The relationship between a measurement_unit and any   qualifer that can be used against that measurement unit is defined in the   table “measurements” – this needs to be observed fully or CDS will generate   an error. Measurements have start and end dates against them, and these also   need to be observed.\n\n\nME63\nThe validity period of the measurement unit must span the   validity period of the measure.\nRequired   Measurement units have start dates end dates – we need   to observe these start and end dates in the creation of measures. We are not   offering a tool to manage measurement units in the first instance.\n\n\nME64\nThe validity period of the measurement unit qualifier must   span the validity period of the measure.\nRequired   Measurement unit qualifiers have start dates end dates   – we need to observe these start and end dates in the creation of measures.   We are not offering a tool to manage qualifiers in the first instance.\n\n\nME105\nThe referenced duty expression must exist.\nRequired   There is a specified list of duty expressions that can   be used in TAP / CDS. We must not use any duty expressions that are not   valid.\n\n\nME106\nThe VP of the duty expression must span the VP of the   measure.\nRequired   There are a number of duty expressions that are no   longer valid – they have been end dated (in 1996 and 2016 primarily). We must   not use these.\n\n\nME108\nThe same duty expression can only be used once within   condition components of the same condition of the same measure. (i.e. it can   be re-used in other conditions, no matter what condition type, of the same   measure)\nRequired   Even if an expression that (in English) reads the same   needs to be used more than once in a measure, we must use a different   expression ID, never the same one twice.\n\n\nME109\nIf the flag ‘amount’ on duty expression is ‘mandatory’   then an amount must be specified. If the flag is set to ‘not permitted’ then   no amount may be entered.\nRequired   The three possible values for this field on the   duty_expressions table are:   0 - Permitted   1 - Mandatory   2 - Not permitted   These values must be observed – By the way, we should   not allows users to modify the data associated with duty expressions, as the   knock on impact will be too significant.\n\n\nME110\nIf the flag ‘monetary unit’ on duty expression is   ‘mandatory’ then a monetary unit must be specified.

In Southern Europe, there are tomato growers for whom the overseas suppliers are rivals that threaten their livelihood.\nIn the UK, sheep farmers depend on selling their goods to a UK market hungry for lamb and lamb products; but there is not enough lamb in the UK to satisfy our needs, hence the need to import lamb from New Zealand and other countries.\nThis is a fine balance that needs to be managed carefully in order to support the needs of the two contrasting needs: the need for the nation to consume and need for domestic suppliers to make a living.\nThis is where quotas come in.\n\n\nGet to know Peter Ungphakorn\n\n\nPeter Ungphakorn was a senior information officer with the WTO Secretariat until 2015.\nSince then he has moved into journalism, focusing mainly on international trade rules, agreements and institutions and fortunately making his knowledge available to the public via his Trade Beta Blog.\nThis blog contains very good, simple explainers (for seven and a half year-olds) on a number of topics, including quotas.\n\n\n\n\nRead above about Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs) (less so quantitative restrictions)\nSee also his blog on Meursing tables which simplifies an incredibly complex subject.\n\nWhat is a quota?\n\n\nA quota allows a certain volume of goods to be imported into a country at a reduced duty rate.\nOnce that volume has been imported, then the quota is considered to be exhausted and is no longer available to draw down against.\nAt that point, all importers will be forced to import the goods at the full (or less preferential duty rate).\n\n\nWhat properties does a quota have?\n\n\nReturning to the lamb quota on the previous screen, clicking on the term “092016” shows more detail of the quota.\n“092016” is the quota order number. If any trader wants to take advantage of the preferential duties associated with a quota, then they need to quote that 6-digit quota order number on their import declaration. A quota1 has properties such as those shown here\nThese properties are described on the following pages\n\n\nDefining quotas\nThere are multiple ways of defining and grouping quotas, all of which will be relevant to the delivery of the next iteration of the Tariff Application:\n\n\nAdministration mechanism:\n\n\nFirst come first served \nLicensed\n\nLegislative mechanism:\n\n\nWTO quota\nATQ\npreferential quota as part of an FTA \nsafeguard quota\n\nOrigin quota: \n\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\nIf you were to draw a Venn-style diagram of how these slices fit together, it would look a bit like this:\n\nPreferential vs Non-Preferential quotas\nPreferential quotas\n\n\nThe term preferential means that a single country or bloc is afforded treatment that provides better market access / lower duties than other countries.\nIn practical terms, preferential tariff duties and quotas are almost always made available via (Free) Trade Agreements. The quota is agreed as part of the bilateral negotiation between the two parties that provides each with mutual benefits.\nPreferential quotas are always applied at a specific country or small group of countries.\nWithin the EU, there are a very small number of quotas which are applied to multiple countries (e.g. a wine quota available for imports from multiple W. Balkan countries), but most are aimed explicitly at one country or bloc.\nAmong the few exceptions, Greenland benefits from preferential quotas on seafoods outside of a formal Trade Agreement\n\nNon-Preferential quotas\n\n\nNon-preferential quotas are aimed at maintaining the balance of trade flows on critical goods by opening up a specific volume of market access to all overseas nations – in most cases, the non-preferential quotas are assigned to ERGA OMNES1 (the country group that includes all countries).\nThere are very few officially non-preferential quotas that have been opened up to specific countries only, where there is a need to maintain global trade flows with a less blunt instrument than a global non-preferential quota applied to the entire world, especially where there are trade titans in a particular commodity\nLamb is again a great example of this – there is a non-preferential quota for Erga Omnes (small volume) and much larger non-prefs for specific countries like Chile, Australia and New Zealand – each of which is a dominant player in the lamb trade.\n\nWays of administering quotas\nThere are two methods of administering a quota:\nFirst Come First Served quotas\n\n\nThese are by far the most common of the two types of quota.\nAs the name suggests, a FCFS quota involves making a pot available to traders: whoever claims against that pot first gets to take advantage of the reduced rate.\nIf you’re not quick enough, you miss the opportunity and pay the non-preferential rate.\n\nLicensed quotas\n\n\nThe purpose of a licensed quota is the same as a FCFS quota: to protect the fine balance of trade flows, however the mechanism for applying for usage is very different.\nFor each quota, periods of the year are opened up for importers to apply for licenses from the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) - a division of Defra.\nDuring this period, the RPA accepts these license requests and issues licenses according to the specific rules of the quota\nIn the EU tariff, all licensed quotas’ 6-digit quota order numbers begin with “094”.\n\nOrigin quotas\nSome quotas identify as Origin Quotas (about 25%)\nOrigin quotas allow for specific quantities of some products to receive preferential tariff treatment if the products meet certain conditions, for example a proof of origin can be provided to prove that the goods do in fact come from the specific country.\nOrigin quotas are always preferential in nature.\nFor a good example of an origin quota, please see the cat \u0026 dog food quota in place with Canada, where a proof of origin certificate is explicitly required.\n\nThe reason why this is important is that a quota’s origin status is displayed on the reference documents that accompany a trade agreements (as a schedule to the primary SI).\nWTO quotas\n\n\nThe UK declares a tariff “schedule of concessions” to the WTO which is made up of multiple elements – what interests us most here is:\nthe tariff schedule\nthe schedules for tariff quotas on agricultural and non-agricultural products\nThe quota schedules list the concessions that we will make to overseas nations to provide greater market access to our market than would have been afforded by adopting the MFN rate alone.\nIn most cases, WTO quotas are assigned to the whole world (ERGA OMNES), but in certain cases (e.g. with lamb), the quota concessions are made available to individual countries which major in a certain trade (e.g. New Zealand for lamb).\nAlmost all WTO quotas are agricultural goods (this also applies to the other kinds of quota).\n\n\nAutonomous quotas (ATQs)\n\n\nAutonomous quotas are represented in the tariff as simple “Non-preferential quotas”. These are particularly applicable within the fishing industry. There is contention within the fishing industry between the catching sector and the food and processing sector.\nFor highly consumed goods, such as cod, pollock and prawns, the UK / EU catching industry cannot catch sufficient product to satisfy the needs of the home and international market. Therefore the processing industry needs access to low or zero duty for such products, while the catching industry needs protection by retaining at least some maximum import threshold above which normal tariff duties apply.\nThe autonomous tariff rate quota (ATQ) facilitates this compromise – a quantity of goods can be imported into the EU at zero or low rate, until exhausted, at which point the duty reverts to the third country rate\nATQs are set on a three year cycle: the ATQ duty rate cannot be changed in the course of that 3 year cycle, however the starting balance for each year can be assessed at the start of each year.\nFor fisheries ATQs, there is an additional point of interest, that, if 80% or more of the quota has been exhausted by the end of September in any given year, then the balance of the quota is increased by 20%\nAutonomous Quotas so called, as the EU unilaterally decides to open a quota – there is no requirement for recourse to WTO approval to open an ATQ.\nIt is anticipated that the ATQs will continue to operate post-Brexit as they are favoured within the Defra ministry and offer a compromise to the different parts of the industry.\n\nWhat products are covered by quotas?\n\nIdentifying quota types\n\n\nUnfortunately, it is not a simple matter to take a quota order number and determine what kind of quota is being used. In the EU Tariff:\n\n\nAll current EU quota order numbers begin with 09 without exception\n“094” means licensed quota\nAutonomous agriculture quotas begin 0977\nAutonomous fisheries quotas begin 0987\n\nApart from that, there are few obvious rules that define the EU’s use of quotas.\nThe system for identifying quotas in the UK tariff will be determined in the course of 2020.\n\nManaging quota order numbers\n\n\nDIT must take the lead in managing quota order numbers – this process has been introduced but not properly observed.\nIt needs to be a consultative process between DIT, HMRC and Defra to avoid errors and confusion, e.g. reusing existing quota order numbers\nHow quotas get set up is dependent on what they have been used for previously – we have inadvertently selected quota order numbers that were a cross section of closed and open quota order numbers, which have caused management challenges in previous migrations.\nAs of March 26th, the likelihood is that quota order numbers in the UK will be using ”08” as their first two digits to differentiate from the EU, with specific challenges around the dual Tariff in Northern Ireland being the primary cause. This remains to be agreed and properly analysed however.\n\nQuotas in reference documents\n\n\n\nTo the left is a sample of the quota section of a reference document – it lists the quotas that are applicable to a given country or trading bloc (here is a mocked-up reference document for the ESA1 trading bloc).\nThe three highlighted data elements (with largely made up data for illustration purposes only), are data fields over and above what the Taric requires: these are not data that is needed by the HMRC systems, but is of benefit to creating reference documents.\nIn TAPv1, the reference document creation service had been created as a totally separate application (using Python / Django), whereas in round 2, it needs to be integrated.\nPlease see the training document on reference documents for more information\n\nFirst Come, First Served Quotas\n\nFirst Come, First Served quotas are far more prevalent than licensed quotas on the Tariff database.\nAs the name suggests this favours those traders that apply for the quota first\nThen, once the initial volume assigned to the quota has been fully depleted, the quota is deemed to be exhausted and is no longer available to draw down against. Once depleted, the trader’s import then falls back on the next best import duty, which may be a tariff preference, but it more likely just the MFN duty.\nThere is an important difference in the way in which FCFS are managed compared to licensed quotas:\nFCFS quotas pass through the HMRC systems that are of greatest interest to the DIT Tariff Application (CHIEF and CDS)\nLicensed quotas do not touch HMRC systems: instead they are handled essentially off-system via the RPA (see following slides)\nThe way in which the DIT application handles the different types of quotas is very different, as will be discussed.\n\nFirst Come First Served (FCFS) quotas: in the EU and with CHIEF\nThis diagram shows the data flows of traders making declarations on CHIEF against the EU’s quota allocation system for first come, first served quotas. At the time of writing (March 2020), 100% of the UK’s FCFS quota-related trade goes via this route (i.e. no involvement from CDS).\n\nFirst Come First Served (FCFS) quotas: in the EU still and with CDS\nThe migration of CHIEF to CDS had been planned some time before the referendum, as CHIEF is legacy software that, despite being highly reliable, is difficult to maintain and extend to cater for new requirements (such as full adherence to the UCC -  Union Customs Code). This diagram is an extension of the previous diagram while CHIEF is excluded from this diagram (to save complexity), it will still be in place for some time anyway – and thanks to the NI Protocol, probably for another 2 years at least. In reality, this planned architecture will not be available to GB traders for the foreseeable future, thanks to the required pivot to support NI.\n\nNI Protocol has changed the approach to CDS migration and this impacts quotas\nThe NI Protocol requires (over-simplified):\n\n\nall goods imported into Northern Ireland to be subject to EU regulatory controls in full\nall goods considered to be at risk of entering the EU via the NI / ROI boundary to be subject to EU import duties\nwhile those goods that are not at risk are subject to GB duties\n\nThis requires 2 tariffs to be present to work out the applicable duties based on the circumstances of the individual trade. This is too complex to do in CHIEF and a huge overhead to do in two systems concurrently anyway.\nTherefore CDS is now designated solely for NI traders (plus the 10 traders that have already been migrated), whereas all other (GB) traders will remain on CHIEF until a future date (to be specified).\nThe impact on quotas is that, by extension, imports to NI of at risk goods may still claim on EU quotas, and these requests will continue to need to be allocated via the EU Quota 2 system while UK quotas will be allocated by the new CDS Quota Allocation Module (QAM). There is a strong possibility for confusion for traders if the UK continues to share the same quota order numbers as the EU.\nArchitecture to support NI post Transition Period\nKey points to note in this diagram – CDS will have two tariff modules, one served by the EU to support NI regulatory controls and at risk duties, the other to support GB trade and NI not at risk trade. In theory (to be negotiated and unlikely to be deliverable by Jan 21), NI at risk goods will be able to take advantage of EU quotas, and therefore be allocated via Quota 2, not QAM. CHIEF GB declarations will send quota requests to QAM for allocation.\n\nThe Taric and FCFS quotas\nThe data objects that are utilised for FCFS are vastly more numerous than those used for licensed quotas\nLicensed quotas essentially use just measures not any of the other quota related tables. That is because all the other tables are set up uniquely to manage the set up and decrementing of quota balances.\n\nThe timespans of a FCFS quota\n\n\nThere are no limits on the periods that quotas can span, but there are commonalities, which these pages aim to share.\nThere are no quotas that are essentially one-offs – a quota is a permanent instrument to balance trade, not a one-time hit. The only slight deviation from this concerns the quotas that have been put in place to provide checks and balances on the import of steel goods (Steel safeguards), which evolve annually: this is just because the instrument is immature, not because it is a one-off.\nThe following types of quota periodicity can be found in the tariff:\n\n\nAnnual full year quota running from Jan 1st to December 31st and repeating every year\nAnnual full year quota running from another start date (e.g. July 1st to June 30th) and repeating every year\nPart year quota running from any date to any other date (e.g. Feb 14th to May 31st) and repeating between the same dates every year\nQuarterly quota running from Jan 1st to December 31st and repeating on that pattern every year\nQuarterly quota running from another start date but lasting a full 12 months and repeating on that pattern every year\nPart year quota split into monthly sections and repeating every year\n\nThese periods are enshrined in the legislation that engenders them – there is no deviation on the start and end dates of the periods (though watch out for leap years)\n\nTimespans in graphical format\n\nImpact of European growing seasons\n\nThere are more factors at play in determining quota volumes and periods than growing seasons (or marketing periods as they are called), but time of year is important for the EU, especially for Mediterranean countries.\nIn time, seasonality may be of less importance to the UK, as our climate does not (yet) suit the industrial levels of production seen in Southern Europe.\nQuota staging\n\n\nThe ultimate goal of a trade agreement is often to get to a place where there is a 0% import duty on goods being imported\nBut, if that goal were to be reached immediately, the toxic shock to domestic producers would be potentially crippling, as  internal markets are swept away in one fell swoop by cheap and abundant imports.\nTherefore the idea of staging has been adopted to allow domestic businesses to adjust to the new reality over time.\nStaging periods equate to the period over which a trade agreement reaches it ultimate goal:\n\n\nfor tariff preferences, this is usually finite. For example, an agreement may include the goal to reduce an import duty from 10% (the pre-agreement MFN) to 0% over 4 years, reducing by 2.5% per year. After 4 years, the duty remains at 0% for as long as the agreement remains in place\nfor staging in quotas, there is no finite end goal, just an increase in the volume of goods made available to the quota. For example at the start of a trade agreement, a quota may permit the import of 100,000 KGM of goods at a reduced rate. The agreement states that an additional 10,000 KGM are permitted per year. I have not seen a ceiling placed on this (e.g. an extra 10,000 KGM a year until it reached 200,000 KGM), but that does not mean it does not happen. The relaxation always takes place against the quota volume, not against the in-quota duties.\n\nStaging often appears in quotas created as part of a Trade Agreement, but never in WTO quotas or ATQs\n\nSafeguard quotas\n\n\nSince 2018, the EU has imposed quotas as part of its Steel Safeguards programme. Since 2017, USA has imposed swingeing import duties on steel and related goods coming into the country in order to protect its own industry from collapse\nThis led to a huge increase in the quantities of such goods coming into the European Union, as manufacturers (usually in the Far East), who previously had easy pickings in USA, now had to seek alternative markets.\nThe knock-on impact was felt in EU domestic steel suppliers, hence the imposition of steel safeguards by the EU.\nSafeguards had been extremely rare in the EU until 2018 and the use of quotas to support them had never been seen. Now they are part of the EU’s defence armoury and will be adopted largely like-for-like by the UK after the end of the implementation period.\nThe safeguard works like this:\n\n\na punitive duty of 25% import duty (type 696 – Additional duties (safeguard)) is applied to multiple steel products grouped in 28 categories. The duty is applied to c. 100 countries\nthen individual quotas are overlaid to remove the duties for certain countries up to a given volume – different quotas are set up for each of the 28 groups (with many country exclusions), some of the quotas being annual and some of the quotas being quarterly\n\nThis function is documented in detail elsewhere – warning: it is hugely complex and warrants very detailed attention.\nKnowing about the concepts behind quotas before digging into the safeguards will prepare you for the complexity.\n\nIntroductory periods\n\n\nThere are very many cases where an annual cadence is set up for a quota with an introductory period at the start that allows the quota to, for example, coincide with the Day One live implementation of a trade agreement, but to still allow the cadence to follow a marketing period.\nThis ‘introductory period’ will be critical also in the migration of quotas from the EU to the UK – if the implementation period ends on December 31st 2020, then there will be many quotas which will naturally start in the UK tariff on 1st January 2021, \n\n\nThis is the mode (annual quotas that run for a calendar year).\nBut, any quota that does not commence on Jan 1st for its annual cadence will potentially require an introductory period\nfor example, an annual quota that starts on July 1st will require a 6-month introductory period\nthe steel safeguard quotas that typically run in quarters from July 1st to June 30th will require two introductory periods of three months each\nbut a quotas which runs from Valentine’s day to the end of June will not\n\n\nIn-depth view of data tablesQuota data structures and fields\nThe next slides go through the structure of quotas as per the Taric, starting with the overarching quota object, the quota order number table.\n\nKey data fields - Quota order number table\n\n        \n          \nField\nNotes\n\n\nquota_order_number_sid\n•A unique sequential numeric   (internal) identifier for the quota.   •There may be more than one   instance of a quota order number ID in the quota order number table, with   different IDs\n\n\nquota_order_number_id\n•6-digit numerical field, e.g.   ‘091234’. In all current cases, the quota order number begins with the 2   digits ‘09’.   •If the first three digits are   ‘094’, then the quota must be a licensed quota: HMRC do not want to receive   data in the quota tables for such quotas.   •Depending on the needs of the   Northern Ireland Protocol, we may want to change away from using 09 as the   opening 2 digits, in order to clearly differentiate UK and EU quota order   numbers.   •Quota order numbers are not a   unique key: it it possible, and is frequently the case that an order number   is set up for a given period of time, then terminated, and restarted again at   a later date, either to reuse the order number for other purposes or because   the policy returns after an intermission.   •Additionally, quota order numbers   are terminated then restarted when the origins or origin exclusions change   •When a quota order number is used   on multiple occasions, a new record with a unique quota_order_number_sid   is created.\n\n\nValidity   start date\nThe   date on which a quota is first set up for use. A quota will then have   multiple periods either in-year or across multiple years, potentially with   introductory custom periods before the regular cadence commences\n\n\nValidity   end date\nThe   date on which the quota order number record terminates – this should, in   nearly every circumstance, be left blank – see pages on origins and origin   exclusions below for the exceptions\n\n\n        \n      \n\nThe quota order number table’s quota order number ID is linked to the measures table via the measures table’s ordernumber field (one of many examples where common field names do not match in Taric).\nThere are links also to the definition and origin tables (see below)\n\nThe quota definition table\n\n\nThe quota definition table is the table which defines the cadence of the quota and the volume of the goods that can be imported at reduced rates during each period.\nThe definition table does not contain any information about:\n\n\nthe commodity codes that are impacted\nthe geographical areas from which goods can be imported\nthe in quota duties that apply\n\nThere are a lot of tables that impact quotas, but the four to the right do the bulk of the work – the division of labour is noted\nYou may also hear quota definition referred to as quota account by HMRC.”\n\n\nThe quota definition in pictures\n\n\nThis graphic shows the relationship between quota order numbers and quota definitions (quotas are invented)\nImagine a world where a new regime starts, brand new on Jan 1st – it is virgin territory with nothing preceding it: this is not the case with the UK’s exit from the EU, where we will be continuing as much as we can.\nWe want all quotas to start asap (unless set to specific marketing periods)\n\n\nKey data fields - Quota definition table\n\n        \n          \nField\nNotes\n\n\nquota_definition_sid\n•A unique sequential numeric   (internal) identifier for the quota definition.   •There may be more than one   instance of a quota order number ID in the quota order number table, with   different IDs\n\n\nquota_order_number_id\n•Foreign key linking to the quota   order numbers table\n\n\nvalidity_start_date\n•The start date of the definition   period – this, along with the end date (below) is the critical date in   defining the active period of the quota definitions, against which the trader   can draw down.   •The quota definition periods   should run alongside the equivalent measures, however:   •The measures and definition   periods are obviously separate tables and provision must be made by the   application programmer to ensure that the measures and the quota definition   periods run concurrently to the same start dates and end dates   •The quota will not operate   without the measure or the definition period\n\n\nvalidity_end_date\n•End date of the period – see   above\n\n\nquota_order_number_sid\n•Foreign key to the SID of the   quota order number\n\n\nvolume\n•The current volume of the quota   definition – when DIT first set the volume, it should be set to the initial   volume.   •Once the quota is ‘handed over’   to HMRC and the start date has passed, DIT then has no ability to impact the   volume of the quota definition. If we try to send over an update to the   definition where the quota volume changes, the change will be rejected.    •We can only change the end date   and the description once the definition has started (formally), however this   is in name only, as there is no way of matching all the fields in the DIT XML   with the HMRC current data set and we cannot send over partial XML: once the   start date has passed, we can no longer influence the volume.\n\n\ninitial_volume\n•The initial volume of the quota –   this remains constant in the HMRC systems post-initiation of the definition   period.   •We set the volume and initial   volume to the same figure   •Only the volume decrements in   HMRC systems   •Volume is dependent of the units   (see next slide)\n\n\nmeasurement_unit_code\n•The primary unit in which the   quota volume is measured   •Usually this will be kilogrammes,   sometimes it is litres, of number of items   •In migrating from the EU data set   into the UK data set, watch out for sloppiness and inconsistency in the   legislation compared to the implementation – this can affect the units in   which quotas are declared.   •In terms of operationalising a   quota, it is preferable to use a smaller unit rather than a large one – i.e.   you will see most quotas are defined against a unit of KGM rather than TNE   (tonne), as this allows traders to bring in smaller amounts and account for   them accurately.   •The legislation will often refer   to tonnes – you will need to multiply the volumes by 1,000 in that case\n\n\nmeasurement_unit_     qualifier_code\n•If the measurement unit needs   further definition, then the measurement unit qualifier code can be used to   provide that additional definition: it is used sparingly. See the document on   measure components for more info, as the concept for quota definitions is the   same,\n\n\nmaximum_precision\n•This is invariably set to 3 these   days. It determines the number of decimal places that a trader can enter into   their declaration form requesting an allocation (allows for grams of goods to   be imported against a quota measured in kilos)\n\n\ncritical_state\n•The critical state determines if   a trader needs to pay securities (essentially a deposit) when utilising the   quota.   •There are two states Yes or No.   If the state is set to Yes, then securities are required; if set to No, then   securities are not required.   •DIT do not need to care about the   mechanism for collecting securities, as this falls into the HMRC domain   •It it is a DIT responsibility to   set criticality however for all definitions: the unwritten rules around   criticality are described in a few slides time\n\n\ncritical_threshold\n•The criticality threshold   determines the point at which a quota definition / account slips into being   critical. Almost without exception on the entire tariff an without exception   in the last 5 years, the criticality threshold is set to 90.   •This means that once 90% of the   quota volume has been used up, the quota will be automatically changed to   ‘Critical’   •See below for more information on   quota definition states and criticality threshold.\n\n\nmonetary_unit_code\n•In the EU tariff, there are a few   quotas that are measured according to the total value   of the goods coming into the bloc rather than weight / volume etc.   •See   quotas 090103, 090101, 090106, 090104, 092501, 092501, 090825, 090786   •The   first 6 of these are silk or fine materials: presumably they are so gossamer   thin that weight is irrelevant and only monetary value is of interest   •The   others are house plants etc from Norway, which is a quota that we do not   intend to pursue in the UK (at the last count)   •It   is an oddity of Taric that, even though there are values in the measurement   unit table that look like they could be used for this purpose, they are not   used in this way (EURO - Euro – for statistic purposes is a valid measurement   unit)   •Even though the UK tariff shows   no inclination of adopting any of these 8 quotas, we will still need to   maintain this functionality going forward: what if we do introduce quotas on   silk products in the future? That may be unlikely, as we have no silk industry   in the UK of course (it is big in Italy).\n\n\ndescription\n•This field has little overt value   and no way of exposing it to the trading public, however it is of value to   populate the field to provide an ‘at a glance’ view of the nature of the   definition.   •It is a weakness of the Taric   data structure that there is no way of defining a ‘description’ of the quota   as a whole.   •TAP 1’s preference was to create   a description against the quota order number itself and then to inherit that   down to the definitions that belong to the quota, appending specifics of the   definition to the definition’s description (such as the dates), though this   could be construed as superfluous.\n\n\n        \n      Criticality\n\n\nAs described above, the critical state determines if a trader needs to pay securities when utilising the quota.\nThe purpose of the requirement to collect securities is to\n\n\na) attempt to provide some sort of level playing field for traders as a quota reaches exhaustion\nb) try to reduce returns towards the end of a definition’s active life span – managing returns is a hassle and if a trader has paid a security, the are less likely to be blasé with unused quota volume.\n\nIt is up to DIT to set the critical state of a quota definition, as we set all the properties of a quota definition period before it has begun, including critical state.\nThe rules of thumb are:\na new quota should be set to critical for three years so that there is an opportunity to study trade flows to determine if the volumes are correct\nsetting critical to ‘Y’ for this period ensures that the trade flow is more reflective of actual trade, dispensing with traders that declare a need for quota volume, but then do not use it.\nBUT at the same time, for HMRC to take securities is a major overhead and they prefer not to in all cases.\nSo, during the 3 non-Brexits to date, the critical state for all quota definition periods has been set to N initially:\n\n\nin order to reduce workload for HMRC\nbecause most trade flows were fairly well known through UK;s membership of the EU\nwe were not introducing many genuinely new quotas (though the maxim was applied to all)\n\nHMRC will need to be consulted in the lead-up to the implementation period on what they want to do with criticality: it is their domain, but our responsibility to set the initial state. This will be especially vital if we kick off any brand new trade deals with new overseas trading partners on Day One, which is remotely possible.\n\nManaging geography\n\nA FCFS quota only works when the full set of quota tables and measure tables are all set up and synchronised. It’s important to understand a few points around the geography of these two entities in order to create the right data.\n* geography has to be set correctly against both the measure and the quota order number\n* while the measures table has a 1-2-1 relationship with geographical areas, the quota order number table can relate to multiple origins via the many-to-many linking table “quota order number origins”.\n*Geographical areas – concepts *\nAssigning quotas to countries\n\n\nA quota can be assigned either to an individual country or to a group of countries\nAs described on the previous page, it may also be assigned to multiple (single) countries as well; theoretically, there is no reason why the quota cannot be assigned to multiple country groups simultaneously, though this has never happened.\nThere are currently (in the EU tariff) several quotas that are assigned to multiple (single) countries, but these will not carry over into the UK tariff (needs to be re-checked).\n\n\nFor example, quota order number 091530 is assigned to import of wines from the Western Balkan states of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.\nWhile the UK will aim to engineer trade agreements with all 6 of these prior to the end of the implementation period, the quotas will be split into individual quotas per country.\n\nThe aim must be to still permit assignment of quotas to multiple countries however, as the model permits it.\nFor each assignment of geographical area to quota order number, the following is required:\n\n\na record in the measures table, linking geographical_area_id and ordernumber.\na record in the quota_order_number_origins table, linking geographical_area_id and quota_order_number_id.\n\n\nExcluding countries from quotas\n\n\nWhen a quota is assigned to a country group, it is possible and very common to exclude countries from that group, such that the quota does not apply to that country. Examples of this are:\n\n\nquotas that apply on food and drink that apply to Central America, but from which Panama is excluded\nalmost all of the steel safeguard quotas feature multiple exclusions.\n\nObviously, the excluded country may be a member of the country group that’s assigned to the quota.\nFor each exclusion of a country from a quota associated to a country group, the following is required:\n\n\na record in the quota order number origin exclusions table, linking the origin and the excluded geographical area.\na record in the measure_excluded_geographical_areas table, linking the origin and the excluded geographical area.\n\n\nKey data fields - Quota order number origins \u0026 exclusions table\n\n        \n          \nField\nNotes\n\n\nquota_order_number_origin_sid\n•A unique sequential numeric   (internal) identifier for the quota origin.   •There may be more than one origin   assigned to a quota order number ID\n\n\nquota_order_number_sid\n•Foreign key to the SID of the   order number to which the origin links\n\n\ngeographical_area_id\n•ID (e.g. NO for Norway) to which   the origin applies\n\n\nvalidity_start_date\n•Date from which the origin   applies to the quota order number\n\n\nvalidity_end_date\n•Date to which the origin applies   to the quota order number\n\n\ngeographical_area_sid\n•Foreign key to the SID of the   geographical area to which the origin links\n\n\n        \n      \n        \n          \nField\nNotes\n\n\nquota_order_number_origin_sid\n•Foreign key to the SID of the   origin from which the country is to be excluded\n\n\nexcluded_geographical_area_sid\n•Foreign key to the SID of the   excluded geographical area\n\n\n        \n      Any entries made in these two quota origin-related tables must also be matched by entries in the measures and measure_excluded_geographical_areas tables.\nStrategies for managing origins and exclusions\n\n\nQuota order number origins have start dates and end dates\nQuota order number origins do not have start dates and end dates\nIf you want to alter the quota order number origin exclusions for a quota, and you don’t want it to happen immediately, you cannot just add the exclusion to the origin: it will take effect immediately, which is almost certainly not the requirement.\nAs case in point is the steel safeguards:\n\n\neach year to date, the origin exclusions have been tweaked as the EU has discovered more about world trade flows and the impact of both the US and EU safeguards on that flow\nthe EU has not been able to just remove and add exclusions\n\nThere are two options:\n\n\neither end the origin and start another origin\nor end the quota order number and start another quota order number with a new origin\n\nThe EU chooses the latter option: terminating the quota order number and replacing with another one starting the next day with a new origin.\n\n\nin TAP1, we followed this route: the alternative route may also be followed.\n\n\nQuota exception periods and events\n\n\n\nLinked to the definition tables are 8 additional tables:\n\n\n2 of these, the period tables are useful – these are discussed in the relevant documents (blocking and suspending quotas)\nThe other 6 are of no interest to DIT in terms of managing the UK tariff – these are reflections of the operational state of EU quotas. As DIT has no interest in the operationalisation of the quotas, we will not need to worry about them.\n\nIf there is a requirement to continue to support the EU tariff, then all data tables should be loaded, including the events tables.\nThe tables are extremely simple nonetheless, should they be required.\nThere is an additional entity in the XSD, the quota.closed.and.transferred.event which is historical\n\nHMRC and DIT responsibilities re: quotas\n\nLicensed quotasQuota data structures and fields\nNone of the quota tables outside of the blue box below are relevant to licensed quotas\n\nLicensed quotas – which products and how many?\n\n\nThe ways to apply for the use of a licensed quota are laid out in the regulations that support them and they may differ according to the product that is concerned.\nLicensed quotas are never used for anything other than agricultural products\n\n\n        \n          \nChapter\nMeasure count\n\n\nChapter   01 - LIVE ANIMALS\n50\n\n\nChapter   02 - MEAT AND EDIBLE MEAT OFFAL\n1011\n\n\nChapter   04 - DAIRY PRODUCE; BIRDS’ EGGS; NATURAL HONEY; EDIBLE PRODUCTS OF ANIMAL   ORIGIN, NOT ELSEWHERE SPECIFIED OR INCLUDED\n260\n\n\nChapter   07 - EDIBLE VEGETABLES AND CERTAIN ROOTS AND TUBERS\n14\n\n\nChapter   10 - CEREALS\n116\n\n\nChapter   11 - PRODUCTS OF THE MILLING INDUSTRY; MALT; STARCHES; INULIN; WHEAT GLUTEN\n13\n\n\nChapter   15 - ANIMAL OR VEGETABLE FATS AND OILS AND THEIR CLEAVAGE PRODUCTS; PREPARED   EDIBLE FATS; ANIMAL OR VEGETABLE WAXES\n1\n\n\nChapter   16 - PREPARATIONS OF MEAT, OF FISH OR OF CRUSTACEANS, MOLLUSCS OR OTHER   AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES\n73\n\n\nChapter   17 - SUGARS AND SUGAR CONFECTIONERY\n62\n\n\nChapter   20 - PREPARATIONS OF VEGETABLES, FRUIT, NUTS OR OTHER PARTS OF PLANTS\n8\n\n\nChapter   35 - ALBUMINOIDAL SUBSTANCES; MODIFIED STARCHES; GLUES; ENZYMES\n13\n\n\nGrand Total\n1621\n\n\n        \n      Licensed quota process – by example (garlic)\n\n\nPossible garlic traders are grouped into two groups:\n\n\nnew importers – 30% of quota licenses are available for new importers\ntraditional importers – 70% of quota licenses are available for traditional importers (those who can prove they have imported garlic frequently over the last x years)\n\nAll declarants must register with the RPA (Rural Payments Agency)\nApplications must be submitted using an import licence application form (AGRIM), downloadable from gov.uk\nQuota applications may be made at certain specific periods in the year (for garlic, applications must be received during the first seven calendar days of April, July, October and January), and must be accompanied by securities and proof of trade\nLicenses are issued within a given date window, and may be used then in a short fixedperiod only from the point of issue\nMost importantly for us, all we need to set up is the relationship between thecommodity, the measure type, the time period, the in-quota duty rate and the origin– there is no concept of number of licenses / import volumes to be concernedabout in DIT.\n\nTAP 1 – Approach to licensed quotas\n\n\nThe approach to building quotas in the first version of the Tariff Application was to not use any of the tables outside of the blue marquee on the previous screen for building licensed quotas.\nThe reason for this was to avoid any data for licensed quotas being sent to the HMRC systems that would cause compatibility issues on arrival. Therefore, that project only used the measures table for licensed quotas\nIt may be considered as useful to use at least the quota_order_number table to capture quota order numbers in the 2nd iteration if this helps certain functions in the new application, such as the quota search function, then it may be advisable to utilise this table\nThe approach needs to be decided by the new team\nThe database that you will receive on arrival will contain no reference to licensed quotas at all in any tables other than the measures table.\n\nJersey, Guernsey and quotas\n\nQuota user needs\n        \n          \nAs a …\nI want to…\nSo that …\nNotes\n\n\nTariff   Manager\nsearch   through a list of existing quotas\nI   can find quotas to export, edit, duplicate, terminate or otherwise operate on   in order to accurately maintain the UK trade policy\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\ncreate   a new (single) quota\nI   can keep both the Tariff Application and the downstream border systems up to   date with the latest trade position.\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\nedit   the properties of an existing quota    -description   -start   date   -end   date   -category   etc.\nI   can update the changes imposed and also be sent to the relevant external   systems.\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\nterminate   an existing measure, either individually or in bulk\nthe   measure will not be imposed on the relevant external systems.\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\ncreate,   edit and terminate origins for a quota\nthe   quota can be applied to imports from a given country or country group\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\ncreate,   edit and terminate definitions for a quota\na   given initial volume can be set for a quota and passed to the border systems   to operationalise\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\ncreate,   edit and terminate suspension periods for a quota\nI   can prevent a quota from being usable for a given period\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\ncreate,   edit and terminate blocking periods for a quota\nI   can block CDS from processing declaration requests that call on a given quota   for a defined period\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\nview   the measures associated with a given quota\nI   can validate that the data that is available on the border systems is correct\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\nview   the commodities associated with a given quota\nI   can validate that the commodities associated with a quota are correct, and to   export that data\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\ncreate,   edit and terminate associations for a quota of type NM\nI   can limit the usage of a quota of given sub-categories of commodities   assigned to a quota, or limit the usage of a quota to a given a country /   origin\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\ncreate,   edit and terminate associations for a quota of type EQ\nI   can apply differential coefficients to the volumes of goods being brought in   on a   quota\nMust   Have\n\n\n        \n      Quota business rules\n        \n          \n#\nDescription\nNotes\n\n\nON1\nQuota order number id + start date must be unique\nRequired – high priority   It is very possible to have more than one quota order number   with the same ID, and this is used for quotas that become obsolete and then   the quota order number is reused.

similarly a single commodity code can have an association with multiple additional codes, again through measures applied to a given combination of commodity and additional code.\n\nWhat are additional codes used for?\n\n\nAdditional codes are now used to manage:\n\n\nMeursing codes – for sugar, flour and milk duties associated with complex agricultural products\nAnti-dumping \u0026 anti-subsidy duties – to identify the specific company to which a punitive measure is attached\nPharma products – to identify that the end use of an imported good is for pharmaceutical purposes, and therefore attracts a reduced duty\nDifferentiating product states / uses / origins (e.g. waste chemicals, underwear [!])\nRoute of ingress – to identify the route goods (wheat \u0026 other cereals) take into EU and to apply different tariff or regulatory treatment\nWorks of art – to identify items stolen from Syria and Iraq as a result of wartime activity\n\nEach of the above uses are discussed in detail on the following slides.\nAdditional codes are made up of 4 digits, which are split into two parts:\n\n\nStructure of additional codes and additional code types\n\n\nMuch like certificates and footnotes, additional codes are made up of a type and then a specific ID, which, when concatenated, form the unique ID of the additional code. .\nFor example, the additional code C233 is constructed of a type © and a specific footnote ID (233) – the entire additional code is known as C233.\nThe numeric IDs, running from 001 to 999 can be reused across multiple additional code type IDs.\nWhile the schema allows for us to use alphanumeric digits for additional codes, not just numeric, these are almost never used and never by the EU – there are 7 national additional codes that are used by HMRC for VAT and excise.\nThe use of the alphanumeric codes may be of great importance to the Northern Ireland protocol, subject to the way in which the solution progresses.\nAdditional code type IDs are always single alphabetical characters (those set by the EU) or single numeric characters (set as national additional code by the UK).\n\n\nOverview of existing additional code types\n\n        \n          \nID\nDescription\nAC count\n\n\n2\nTariff   preference\n5\n\n\n3\nProhibition/Restriction/Surveillance\n118\n\n\n4\nRestrictions\n51\n\n\n7\nAgricultural   Tables (Meursing)\n504   ***\n\n\n8\nAnti-dumping/countervailing\n188\n\n\nA\nAnti-dumping/countervailing\n265\n\n\nB\nAnti-dumping/countervailing\n920\n\n\nC\nAnti-dumping/countervailing\n483\n\n\nV\nVAT\n3\n\n\nX\nEXCISE\n66\n\n\n        \n      ***Meursing additional codes are special cases and stored in a different database table from the other additional codes\n\n\nThe table above lists all of the additional code types which are currently in use, supporting active additional codes.\nThe table below shows all of the additional code types on the database (in use or not)\nAdditional code types cannot be reused if they are not terminated – we will need to create new additional code types for the UK to cater for UK-specific future anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases.\nSee section on Trade Remedies later in this document.\n\n\n        \n          \nID\nDescription\n\n\n2\nTariff   preference\n\n\n3\nProhibition/Restriction/Surveillance\n\n\n4\nRestrictions\n\n\n6\nAgricultural   Tables (non-Meursing)\n\n\n7\nAgricultural   Tables (Meursing)\n\n\n8\nAnti-dumping/countervailing\n\n\n9\nExport   Refunds\n\n\nA\nAnti-dumping/countervailing\n\n\nB\nAnti-dumping/countervailing\n\n\nC\nAnti-dumping/countervailing\n\n\nD\nDual   Use\n\n\nF\nReference   prices fishery products\n\n\nP\nRefund   for basic products\n\n\nV\nVAT\n\n\nX\nEXCISE\n\n\n        \n      Pivot table on usage of additional codes vs measure types\n\nType 2 - Preference codesThere are only two remaining reasons in the EU tariff for using preference type additional codes – when the UK takes over ownership, there will be just one.\n\n        \n          \nCode(s)\nDescription \u0026 notes\n\n\n2   500     2   501\nThese   two codes are used to differentiate between the duties applicable to imported   goods which may or may not be subject to reduced duties for pharmaceutical   products. In the EU, this is legislated for in Annex I of the “Combined   Nomenclature”, Part Three, Section II (pharmaceutical products).          In   the UK these additional codes will persist, though the specific legislative   mechanism for persisting them remains to be decided.\n\n\n2   550     2   551     2   552     2   553\nThese   codes are used in the EU to apply differential duties to goods (wheat,   sorghum and other cereal goods) dependent upon their route of ingress into   the European Union.          These   will not be persisted into the UK tariff: a) because we are not carrying   forward the operationalising of the agricultural policy to apply variable   duties on cereals (though we are retaining the right to revert if required)   and b) the routes are not relevant to a newly-independent UK.\n\n\n        \n      Type 3 – P \u0026 R codesThese codes are on the surface vey similar to those used under additional code type 4 – it is not clear why one might be used in opposition to the other.\n\n        \n          \nCode(s)\nDescription \u0026 notes\n\n\n3   200     3   202     3   203     3   204     3   205     3   206     3   207     3   208     3   249\nThese   additional codes are used to differentiate between specific states of certain   chemical compounds: if the product is in a certain state, then a different   export code restriction applies, as explained in the footnote:          “The   surveillance does not apply to mixtures and natural products which contain   scheduled substances and which are compounded in such a way that the   scheduled substances cannot be easily used or extracted by readily applicable   or economically viable means, to medicinal products as defined in point 2 of   Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the   Council and to veterinary medicinal products as defined in point 2 of Article   1 of Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.”          The   purpose of the these codes is to provide the ability to slice multiple   commodities according to their intrinsic properties.\n\n\n3   601     3   602     3   603\nI   kid you not – this group of additional codes is to apply additional   restrictions to the import of pants and bras from North Korea. The additional   code provides an additional slide over the top of the existing commodities   without creating multiple new comm codes.\n\n\n        \n      Type 4 – Restriction codesThink of this type of additional codes as a means of differentiating between:\npotential multiple uses of goods, where splitting all the codes would be inadvisable, complex, confusing, or impossible\na way of differentiating origin / specifics, even if via several intermediary steps\n\n        \n          \nCode(s)\nDescription \u0026 notes\n\n\n4   008 – 4 099\nThese   codes have been instituted as a means of instituting temporary controls   (restrictions) on goods that have been plundered following the chaos in Iraq   and Syria, for example after the destruction of Palmyra. Rather than   permanently splitting existing commodity codes, typically (but not   exclusively) in chapters 97 and 98 (works of art) etc., the European   Commission has created additional codes to determine origin of goods, even if   they have passed through multiple trades prior to the entry into the EU. For   this reason, many of the controls apply not just to Iraq and Syria, but also   to Erga Omnes / All third countries (1011, 1008 respectively).          Chapters   97 and 98 are very shallow – in some cases, the definitions only go down to   HS4 without any further cleaving of codes – the EU cannot introduce codes at   6 digits, even if that was desirable, so the choice would have been: create a   very few additional codes to designate source OR create a large number of   10-digit codes to represent permanent splits.\n\n\n4   115 to 4 118\nUsed   to apply controls to waste materials and ozone-depleting substances\n\n\n4   200 to 4 212\nUsed   to differentiate the skins and furs of wild cats (e.g. lynxes) as well as   other mammals sometimes (illegally) used for their fur (e.g. otters \u0026   pine martens)\n\n\n        \n      Type 7 - Meursing codes\n\nIntroduced in 1988 by the European Commission. Traders hate them, but we have to keep Meursing classifications or change our WTO commitments.\nThey apply to bakery and confectionery products, etc. classed as “composite agrigoods”. Meursing allows extra set of import duties to be charged depending on how much of 4 agricultural ingredients are used to make the product: milk fat, milk proteins, starch or glucose, or various forms of sugar.\nThe result used to be tens of thousands of categories of composite agrigoods for the purposes of charging import duties. To find the specific ‘recipe’ and the duties applicable, you look it up in the Meursing table (right).\nExecuted in the tariff as a combination of primary measures, such as tariff preferences, with complex duty expression combinations, which are then expanded when the trader select the ‘additional code’ for the specific ‘recipe’ of their product.\nThe best description of Meursing codes and their use is drawn up by Trade expert Peter Unghpakorn on his trade beta blog: https://tradebetablog.wordpress.com/2016/08/18/eu-tariff-biscuit-annex1/\n\n\n\nFuture of Meursing codes\n\n\nThe Meursing code is a staple of EU agrifood trade.\nThe UK policy however is to abandon Meursing codes as an agricultural policy, due to the fact that it is universally disliked by trade and policy (Defra) alike – the tax-raising reasons for it having come into existence in the first place are not UK policy.\nHowever, as with much of the Northern Ireland protocol, there are additional implications for UK government and Northern Ireland traders with NI remaining in a special relationship with the EU’s Customs Union.\nInitial thoughts are that the impact of the NI protocol will not be felt for GB traders, but NI traders will continue to need to apply Meursing codes to imports of specific types if the good is considered to be at risk of being further transported to the EU.\nAt the very least, this requires DIT policy and DDaT to retain some knowledge of the Meursing challenge, even if the majority of the UK will not be subject to the controls\n\nApplication of a Meursing code in detail – Waffles and wafers\n\n\nLet’s take “waffles and wafers - with a water content exceeding 10% by weight”, commodity code 1905320500.\n\nThe third country duty reads as follows:9.00% + EA MAX 20.7% + ADFM\nThis is a complex compound duty involving both a ceiling and a pair of Meursing-related placeholders. These placeholders come in three forms, which, in the EU are labelled:\nEA – Agricultural component \nADFM – Additional duty on flour\nADSZ – Additional duty on sugar (not shown here, but the principle applies)\nThe labels are based on French and German abbreviations (élément agricole, farine / mehl; sucre / Zucker)\nThe next section shows the breakdown – and what traders have to do\n\n\nUnpicking complex agricultural duties\n\n\nThe waffle duty 9.00% + EA MAX 20.7% + ADFM is made up of 4 measure components – please review the training manual on measure components for a detailed view of these.\n\n\n        \n          \nDuty expression ID\nDuty amount\nCommentary\n\n\n01\n9.00\nAd valorem duty\n\n\n12\n-\nMeursing placeholder –   agricultural component\n\n\n17\n20.7\nCeiling ad valorem ( … up to a   maximum of …)\n\n\n27\n-\nMeursing placeholder – additional   duty on flour\n\n\n        \n      \n\nThe first thing to notice is that the Meursing placeholders have no duties assigned to them – it is not possible to assign duty amounts to these measure components; they operate as placeholders that are filled in only when traders declare the content of the various delicious ingredients.\nThe trader goes to (for example) the gov.uk URL below, enters the component %ages and then is eventually presented with a 4-digit code, such as 7364.\nDuties are then assigned specifically against the Meursing additional code 7364, totally independent of the hundreds of commodities that are subject to them – this is unique in the tariff database, where duties are usually against combinations of commodity codes and additional codes - not with Meursings.\n\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/additional-commodity-code\nImplications for Tariffs project\n\n\nAlthough it is theoretically possible that the UK will need to manage Meursing additional codes and their associated duties in the future, it is highly unlikely\nRecommendation would be that no interface functionality is constructed to allow for managing Meursing codes themselves, as it is hugely complex.\nTheoretically, if we wanted to just change the duties associated with the Meursing additional codes, this is possible: it is a matter of assigning duties direct to an additional code, rather than to a combination of commodity codes and additional codes.\n\nMeursing table and the reduction indicator\n\n\nThere is one Meursing table but multiple layers of tariffs assigned against it\nThe “reduction indicator” is assigned to the tariff measure on the commodity code and to the duty assigned to the additional code. The border system picks the indicator that matches to select the right duty.\nIn use with multiple preferential agreements that reference composite agrigoods.\nJapan goes to town on the usage of reduction indicators, forcing the EU to change its Taric schema to accommodate another three reduction tables.\nBy the end of the implementation period, be aware of two facts:\nwe will have done away with the concept of Meursing codes in the UK, therefore the reduction indicator will be irrelevant\nwe will not have a trade agreement with Japan\nBUT:\nwe will need to honour the NI protocol, meaning Meursings will apply to imports of at risk goods from RoW and GB to NI, meaning DIT and DDaT need to continue to be aware of their presence.\n\n\nType 8, A, B, C – Anti-subsidy / anti-dumping codesA Trade Remedy is explained elsewhere, but the important thing to note is that, for the two types of trade remedy that are by some distance the most abundant, Anti-dumping duties and Anti-subsidy duties, the punitive import duties are set against specific exporting companies that are deemed to have acted unlawfully, not against entire countries.\nEssentially, a company is proven to have been dumping1 its goods on an overseas market (e.g. the European Union or the United Kingdom), or to have been receiving unlawful state subsidy to undercut international competitors, and this activity is found to have been damaging businesses in those overseas nations. In such cases, the nation or bloc’s Trade Remedies body, such as our own Trade Remedies Authority, is entitled to investigate and impose punitive duties specifically against the companies that have been proven to have acted unlawfully.\nIn the case of Trade Remedies, the 4-digit additional code is set to represent the company from which the good is imported, or in some cases, a multitude of companies that have been found guilty of the same infraction.\n\n\nBy way of example:\nCode C316 refers to Bengang Steel Plates Co., Ltd (Benxi, Liaoning)\nCode C333 refers to all of:\n* Aeolus Tyre Co., Ltd;\n* Aeolus Tyre (Taiyuan) Co., Ltd;\n* Qingdao Yellow Sea Rubber Co., Ltd;\n* Pirelli Tyre Co., Ltd\nTo create a punitive trade remedy duty against a the import of “flat rolled steel” from “Bengang Steel Plates”, you assign a 552 measure against commodity code 7225990092 and additional code C316.\n\nWhen the European Commission first set up the Taric database to cater for all trade eventualities, they were somewhat guilty of short-sightedness when it came to Trade Remedies.\nThey set up the additional type code ‘8’ in 1972 to deal with all future companies implicated in Trade Remedy cases. To be fair, this lasted until 1999, when the 1,000 possible permutations within the ‘8 ‘ type code (000 to 999) were exhausted. They then moved on to using ‘A’. In 2013, they moved on to ‘B’ and in ‘2015’ to ‘C’. By 2019, type ‘C’ was already half used up, so the expectation would be that they will move on to another additional code type within the next 2 years.\n‘D’ is already used for dual use codes, albeit it is currently dormant.\nIn preparing for the multiple abortive stabs at EU Exit, the project team has (via scripts) created an additional set of additional code types (‘E’ and ‘F’) to cater for the inevitable expansion and deviation.\nAdditional codes, according to the Taric schema may be alphabetical, as well as numeric – alpha characters have never been used by the EU, but there is no reason why we could not use them in the future in the UK.\n\n\nAdditional codes used in Trade Remedies measures are essentially meaningless beyond Tariff – there is literally no reference against any international database of companies, nor any attempt to make the data set atomic and ‘cleansed’\nYou are likely to find multiple instances of the same company cropping up in the database on multiple occasions.\nBe careful about the shenanigans that companies get up to evade punitive duties – most often by setting up subsidiaries in overseas nations with similar names: these are not the same company, nor the same additional code, but they may have very similar company names.\n\nAdditional codes cannot be applied universally …\nThere is an additional many to many table within the tariff database that determines which additional code types can be used against which measure types. Currently there are 74 permutations of additional codes against measure types: there is little surprising about the alignment – e.g. you can only assign additional codes of type 8, A, B or C to measure types that are associated with Trade Remedies.\n\nAdditional codes, additional code types data entities\n\nScreen designs[LEAVING THIS SECTION OUT AS NOT YET DECIDED WHERE THIS SECTION SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE MANUAL -

However code combinations can be reused over time,   hence the use of the additional code SID field – an internal identifier to   identify specific instances of these combinations, as they may be reused.   Therefore this must be checked.     In actual fact, the rule is written incorrectly here.   There must be no overlap in time between two codes both identified with the   same additional code type and additional code – you need to check for this   overlap, which is not permitted, rather than just the coincidence of the   validity start date.\n\n\n\nACN2\nThe referenced additional code type must exist and have as   application code “non- Meursing” or “Export Refund for   Processed Agricultural Goods”.\n\n\n\nRequired     See earlier in this document for more info on   additional code type application codes.

While this is the case in the EU, the UK is trying to abandon this, for example there is a wine quota (09.1530) in use for the West Balkan countries1 that is going to be split into 6 individual quotas post-implementation period.\nA geographical area that is defined as being a country group will have one or more countries (or regions) designated as members of that country group.\n\nIdentifying geographical areas\n\nAn identifier for a country group (geographical_area_id) is structured depending on the type of area in question.\nThe geographical code field dictates what type of geographical area is involved:\n\n\n0 Country\n1 Country group\n2 Region\n\nFor all countries and regions, the code is a 2-digit upper-case alphabetical string\n\n\nFor countries, this is based on the international standard (ISO_3166-1) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2)\nFor regions, i.e. unincorporated states, the code is typically a 2-digit string beginning with X, followed by the first letter of the country. e.g. as an upshot of the splintering of the former Yugoslavia, Serbia and Kosovo were formed as ‘regions’, not countries: Serbia = XS, Kosovo = XK. Even though Serbia is now a fully recognised sovereign state, it remains a region (practical implications of flipping; Kosovo is still officially considered to be a part of Serbia by over half the world).\n\nFor country groups, the code is an alpha-numeric string of 4-digits.\n\n\nFor country groups set up by the EU, these 4-digit strings are always numeric, e.g. 1001 = Erga Omnes (whole world)\nFor nationally setup groups (historically managed by HMRC), the groups are alpha-numeric, for example F006 (Phytosanitary certificates)\n\n\nAbout country groupsThe last example on the previous page (F006 Phytosanitary certificates) shows that the country groups do not have to align to an enshrined globally understood trading entity like EU (1011), CARIFORUM (1033) or GSP LDC (2005).\nBecause the meat and drink of Taric and TAP is to produce measures, which can be connected to just one single geographical area, it is often simpler just to create a group of countries and apply the measure to the group and not the individual countries.\nThis can often be at the expense of making total sense however. For example, to execute the regulations associated with handloomed products, a group has been set up to accommodate the countries to which a quota applies for such products – the name of the group is “Silk or cotton handloom products”.\n\nGeographical area membershipGeographical areas that represent country groups (area code 1) are designed to include member countries\nA geographical area group can only contain regions or countries (area codes 0 and 2), not other geographical area groups – any attempt to assign a country group to another country group as a member must not be permitted and cause a business rule failure at HMRC. A geographical area’s membership of a country group is bookended by a start date and potentially and end date, where absolutely required.\nWhile geographical areas are absolutely not a volatile area within the application, and the changes are few and far between, there are a number of use cases where membership does change, albeit infrequently. For example, countries move in and out of GSP tiers from year to year as their progress or decline economically.\nSteel safeguards work on country groups created specifically for the purpose of applying punitive duties against large numbers of countries; these groups tend to change from year to year, as we learn more about the impact of the punitive duties on trade flows.\nThe UK may choose to create country groups to apply specific regulatory controls.\nRelationship of measures to geographical areas\n\nAll measures are assigned to precisely one geographical area.\nThat area may be a country, region (non-incorporated country) or a group of countries.\nIf the geographical area is a country group, then it is possible to exclude (one or more) members of that country group from the measure via inclusion in the measure_excluded_geographical_areas table.\nThe excluded country must be a member of that group.\nPlease note: both the excluded_geographical_area and geographical_area_id fields refer to the excluded country, not the group.\n\nRelationship of quotas to geographical areas\n\nAll quotas need to be represented both as measures and within the structures related to quotas.\nWith licensed quotas, these are only represented by quotas.\nThe relationship of geographical areas to quotas needs to be reflected in both the measures and quotas structures (except for licensed quotas).\nTherefore both the relationship of quotas to their origins and measures to the related geographical areas needs to be managed and synchronised in the data creation.\n\nKey user needs – geographical area\n        \n          \nAs a …\nI want to …\nSo that …\nNotes\n\n\nTariff Manager\ncreate a new geographical area of type country or region\nI can assign duties or regulatory measures specifically to that country or region\nMUST HAVE This will be an extremely infrequent activity; very few new countries spring up.

The Taric is subdivided however by the Taric sub-positions (from the ninth place) more deeply.\nAs the combined nomenclature is not sufficiently detailed to support the community tariff and commercial legislation, the 8-digit codes can be broken down into 10-digit codes called “TARIC codes”. \nThese codes are created at any time, according to the legislative needs.\n\nimage\nHarmonised system sections\n\n\nThe Harmonised System is categorised into sections and chapters\nThe section is a logical grouping that is not reflected in the nomenclature.\nEach chapter, which is a subdivision of a section, is fully self-contained within the logical section.\nSections are represented by Roman numerals (1 to 21 / I to XXI)\n\nimage\n\n        \n          \nID\nDescription\n\n\nI\nLive   animals; animal products (chapter 1 - 5)\n\n\nII\nVegetable   products (chapter 6 - 14)\n\n\nIII\nAnimal   or vegetable fats and oils and their cleavage products; prepared edible fats;   animal or vegetable waxes (chapter 15)\n\n\nIV\nPrepared   foodstuffs; beverages, spirits and vinegar; tobacco and manufactured tobacco   substitutes (chapter 16 - 24)\n\n\nV\nMineral   products (chapter 25 - 27)\n\n\nVI\nProducts   of the chemical or allied industries (chapter 28 - 38)\n\n\nVII\nPlastics   and articles thereof; rubber and articles thereof (chapter 39 - 40)\n\n\nVIII\nRaw   hides and skins, leather, furskins and articles thereof; saddlery and   harness; travel goods, handbags and similar containers; articles of animal   gut (other than silkworm gut) (chapter 41 - 43)\n\n\nIX\nWood   and articles of wood; wood charcoal; cork and articles of cork; manufactures   of straw, of esparto or of other plaiting materials; basketware and   wickerwork (chapter 44 - 46)\n\n\nX\nPulp   of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic material; recovered (waste and scrap)   paper or paperboard; paper and paperboard and articles thereof (chapter   (chapter 47 - 49)\n\n\nXI\nTextiles   and textile articles (chapter 50 - 63)\n\n\n        \n      \n        \n          \nID\nDescription\n\n\nXII\nFootwear,   headgear, umbrellas, sun umbrellas, walking-sticks, seat-sticks, whips,   riding-crops and parts thereof; prepared feathers and articles made   therewith; artificial flowers; articles of human hair (chapter 64 - 67)\n\n\nXIII\nArticles   of stone, plaster, cement, asbestos, mica or similar materials; ceramic   products; glass and glassware (chapter 68 - 70)\n\n\nXIV\nNatural   or cultured pearls, precious or semi-precious stones, precious metals, metals   clad with precious metal and articles thereof; imitation jewellery; coins   (chapter 71)\n\n\nXV\nBase   metals and articles of base metal (chapter 72 - 83)\n\n\nXVI\nMachinery   and mechanical appliances; electrical equipment; parts thereof, sound   recorders and reproducers, television image and sound recorders and   reproducers, and parts and accessories of such articles (chapter 84 - 85)\n\n\nXVII\nVehicles,   aircraft, vessels and associated transport equipment (chapter 86 - 89)\n\n\nXVIII\nOptical,   photographic, cinematographic, measuring, checking, precision, medical or   surgical instruments and apparatus; clocks and watches; musical instruments;   parts and accessories thereof (chapter 90 - 92)\n\n\nXIX\nArms   and ammunition; parts and accessories thereof (chapter 93)\n\n\nXX\nMiscellaneous   manufactured articles (chapter 94 - 96)\n\n\nXXI\nWorks   of art, collectors’ pieces and antiques (chapter 97 - 99)\n\n\n        \n      Concept definition \u0026 terminology 2\n\n\nThe UK refers to the full list of products in the UK Tariff as the Goods Classification – this is synonymous with the broad name for the full list of products: goods nomenclature or just nomenclature.\nIn the EU, this is referred to under multiple names: often the EU refers to the Tariff as the “Combined Nomenclature” (CN), though officially this refers only to the first 8 digits of the code.\nWithin the broader body, the individual elements referring to specific products are called commodity codes.\nThe commodity code is what is entered into the SAD (C88) form – the Single Administrative Document that acts as the import declaration form – see ringed box to the right.\nThere is a total of 24,504 commodity codes (as of 1st December 2019): of these 15,887 are declarable end-lines (see definition later).\n\n\nConcept definition \u0026 terminology 2\nThere are three key concepts to understand in this section. All of these have a significant impact on the measures that can be defined and managed by Tariff Managers:\n\n\ncommodity codes\nproduct line suffixes\nindents\n\n\nCommodity codes, product line suffixes and indents in practice\n\n\nThe schematic to the right illustrates a ‘hierarchy’ starting from the very first commodity code in the Tariff (0100 00 00 00) down to the last end-line under the 1st major HS heading branch (0101 90 00 00), i.e. Live horses, asses, mules and hinnies\nThis shows the commodity codes, split into segments for ease of reading, the product line suffix and the indent, as well as the current description of the commodity code.\nThe physical indent on the description matches the indent field.\nHence, Horses is a ‘child’ of ‘Live horses, asses, mules and hinnies’ and ‘Pure-bred breeding animals’ is a child of ‘Horses’ – however these relationships are inferred, not explicit.\nYou will notice that there are two zeroes at the start of the tree – this is a slightly bewildering treatment from the EU, but we need to work with it: the HS chapter and the HS heading both use an indent of 0. This will not be of huge immediate interest, as these codes will not change until the lead-up to January 2022.\n\n\nIf one were to try and print out the whole commodity tree (c. 24,500 lines), you would:\n\n\nselect the commodity codes with current validity\nsort them by commodity code and then product line suffix\nindent them using the indent field\n\nDeclarability and measure assignment\n\n\nA SAD form requires that the trader enter the most detailed description possible for the good that is being traded, not something vague like ‘Horses’\nThere are two rules that define whether or not a good is declarable, i.e. whether or not it can be entered onto a SAD form:\nfirst, a good must have a product line suffix (PLS) of “80”: anything else cannot be traded – these commodity codes are in the database purely as structural fillers\nsecond, a good must be an end-line aka a leaf. i.e. it must not have any children.\nIn the example to the left, the declarable commodities are those with a      against them\nAlthough 0101 29 00 00, 01010 00 00 00 and 0101 00 00 00 all have a PLS of “80”, they all have child codes underneath them, therefore cannot be declared.\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above (red marquee), it is interesting to note (and this is key in understanding where a product line suffix other than “80” is used), that there are two items with the commodity code 0101 21 00 00.\nOne has a PLS of 10, the other has a PLS of 80.\nThis is common and is likely to be a treatment we need to get used to in the UK for future change.\n\nJams and jellies are very complex\n\n\n\nThe image above shows the complexity of certain hierarchies.\nThe indent numbers have been doctored slightly to show the true number of indents, ignoring the double zero noted previously.\nThere are actually 14 tiers of data in certain points in the hierarchy, as shown here\nThis is exceptional however\nPlease also note the apparently inconsistent use of product line suffixes: why has 2007 99 39 00 got a PLS of “80” when it is clearly an intermediate code?\nThe answer seems to be that the non-80 code is used where there is a need to insert a structural heading with the same commodity code as the subsequent code, presumably due to space restrictions in the hierarchy.\n\nSmashing preconceptions on hierarchical inheritance\n\n\n\nThis is undoubtedly an unusually complex tree, however it does illustrate well a concept that needs to be understood, to help the Tariff management team to grasp the idea of inheritance, which is critical in measure management.\nThe 10-digit commodity code is divided into 5 pairs of digits.\nWhile it is alluring to consider that these two digit pairs provide enough information to work out the hierarchy, this is coincidental, though, certainly at the top of the hierarchy, frequently true.\n\nThere are five main reasons why new commodities are required\nNew commodities - examples\n\nDo not underestimate WCO changes\n\n\n\nThe graph to the left shows the peaks and troughs of nomenclature management over the last 10 years\nThe 2 big peaks are on 1st Jan 2012 and 1st Jan 2017, the to dates in the last 10 years where the WCO has made alterations to their HS6 structures.\nEvery non-WCO year follows a similar peak / trough structure\nBig peak in Jan (annual CN code changes, smaller peak in July (new suspension), ad hoc for the rest of the year\n2019 has been an outlier, as commodity code changes have taken place throughout the year\n\nJanuary 2022 will require a lot of preparation\n\nWCO 5-year changes are significant\n\n\n\nThis shows the change from 31st December to 2nd January on just a small branch 0305 59 00\nMost of these changes were deletions, not creations.\nThe spike of 2,334 was more like 4,500 actual changes\n\nWCO HS correlation tables\n\n\n\nHere is a page from a 60-page correlation table document, comparing the HS systems of 2012 and 2017\nThe WCO specify the changes that are made to the 4 and 6 digit codes that they master.\nBut … the majority of the change is felt lower down the hierarchy.\nYou move a parent, you have to move the children.\nAnd in moving a child, you have to give it a new commodity code, due to the need to sequence by comm code and pls.\nThis really means ending an old comm code and creating a new \n\n\n\nHow will we decide on new commodity codes? How will we facilitate alignment with the EU?The answer has to be that we follow the EU’s changed precisely\nThere are two additional concepts that are useful to know, but play a far smaller part in the management of goods classification. Origins and successorsare intended to create an audit trail when commodity codes change\n\nOrigins\nOrigins\n\n\nAn origin defines the commodity code from which a new commodity code was derived.\nWhen a commodity code is split into two, the ‘origin’ of the two (or more) new commodity codes is the parent commodity code.\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, a successor will have been created for codes 2001 90 70 10 and 2001 90 70 90 of2001 90 70 00.\nIt is mandatory that at least one origin is created for every new commodity code\nHowever, this data is of zero value to the Tariff Application\n\nSuccessors\n\n\nAn successor defines the commodity code into which an existing commodity code has been absorbed.\nIt is not mandatory for a successor code to be created, though they may be created.\n\nResidual codes\n\n\nThe sweet peppers example can also be used to exemplify residual codes.\nA residual code is the code usually labelled ’Other’ which is created when a code is split into a specific and remainder part.\nIn this example 2001 90 70 00 is split into 2 child codes.\n\n\nThe specific code is assigned 10 as the final 2 digits.\nThe residual code is assigned 90 as the final 2 digits.\nIf in future more child codes as added to the parent as siblings to 10 and 90, then these are assigned 20, 30, 40 etc as the final 2 digits, while space remains.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a code is split on the last digit, rather than the last 2 digits, it is usually split into 1 and 9, for example:\n\n\n\n\nThere are more than 6,500 residual codes in the database \n\nManaging goods classification – user needs\n        \n          \nAs a …\nI   want to …\nSo   that …\nNotes\n\n\nUK Tariff Manager\nbrowse through the commodity code hierarchy to find   commodity codes\nI can locate a commodity to perform actions on it or to   review the data associated with it\nMust be able to navigate down through the commodity code   hierarchy through the following tiers:       Section    HS        chapter    HS        heading    HS        subheading    CN        heading    Taric        code      These names may change over time, but refer to the   section, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10-digit codes.\n\n\nUK Tariff Manager\nchange the date forwards or backwards in time when   browsing / finding commodity codes\nI can see the result of future changes on the goods   classification or review the state of the hierarchy at a previous time\nDate selected must be valid and should look no further   back than 1st Jan 1972, which is when the first commodity codes   came into existence.\n\n\nUK Tariff Manager\nview the core details of a current commodity code\nI can determine core info such as end date and identify   next operational steps on this commodity code\nMust show:       10-digit        commodity code    Current        commodity code description    SID    Indent    product        line suffix    Validity        start date    Validity        end date      Do not show:       Statistical        indicator field\n\n\nUK Tariff Manager\nview the current and historical descriptions of a   commodity code\nI can review past descriptions for accountability and   audit purposes and so that I can make a judgement on future changes to those   descriptions\nFor each description, show the following:       Date        from which the description is valid – there is no concept of end date        for description periods    The        textual description – decision will be needed on whether the show the        description with the odd EU characters removed: preference would be to        say yes    Actions        as follows:         Delete         description – only for future descriptions     Edit         description – only for future descriptions          Show also a “Create new description” function\n\n\nAs a …\nI want to …\nSo that …\nNotes\n\n\nUK Tariff Manager\nview the position of a commodity code within the hierarchy   for a given date\nI can assess the activities that will be required when   creating measures on or around the selected commodity (e.g. for business rule   violations)\n    Show        the full hierarchy leading all the way up to the HS chapter (not        required to show the section)    Show        also the full hierarchy downwards, including all subsidiary comm codes        on all branches.

There cannot be more than one entity with the same SID. There can however be   more than one entity with the same compound key of commodity code and product   line suffix, provided the multiple items do not coexist concurrently. The use   case here is that a commodity code has previously been terminated, and then   reinstituted at a later date with the same commodity code and product line   suffix.
