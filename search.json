the reasons or contexts for rates and conditions, and they also indicate rules that the measure types’ measures must comply with, for example, quota measure types require that their measures have a quota order number defined.\n\nIntroduction to measure typesStructure of measure types\n\nEach measure belongs to exactly one measure type. The measure types describe to the border systems how to execute some kind of action on the trade in question (e.g. charge a duty / require a document).\nWhile the data associated with a measure type is a pretty good explainer of what the measure is intended to do, there is a significant amount of work to be done by HMRC to make the measure behave as intended.\n\n\n\n  !\n  \n    Warning\n    It is not enough to create a new measure type and expect it to just work.\n  \n\n\n\nThis is even more important when one considers the continuing role that CHIEF will play during the dual running of the two border systems - CHIEF is unable to extend its measure type capability without programming: at least CDS can be configured to extend its measure type list.\n\n\nAny changes to measures, additions of new measures will need to be agreed by HMRC in advance – their function cannot fully be described in Taric: see anomaly of measure type 696 (used in steel safeguards) below.\nRegulation groups, measure types and Box 36 of the SAD form\n\nIn the regulation training manual, we mentioned the need for regulations to be assigned to the right regulation groups, because of the correlation required between the regulation group and what the trader enters in Box 36 on the SAD form.\nWell the measure type falls into the same bracket – the measure types have to be actively correlated to regulation group IDs by HMRC in CDS.\nTherefore, HMRC need to be involved in measure type creation.\n\n\nMeasure types \u0026 responsibilities prior to the IP\n\nThere are c. 260 measure types in existence prior to the end of the implementation period (IP).\nSome of these have not been used in some time and can be considered as dead, even if they are not formally terminated on the database.\nc. 80 of these are VAT and excise measures that DIT will never get involved in.\nThere remain about 100 measure types that will crop up over the course of the next year and will need to be understood, even if some of these are going to be omitted from the UK tariff (at least in the first instance).\nThe measures that we need to manage can be broadly broken in to the following groups, with the table below showing the division of responsibility between the EU and the member states, represented for the UK by HMRC.\nThese will evolve after the IP (Jan 2021).\n\n\n        \n          \nResponsibility\nInstrument\n\nThe EU\nThird country (MFN) duties     Tariff preferences in Trade Agreements     Quotas in Trade Agreements     WTO quotas     Autonomous tariff quotas     Trade Remedies \u0026 safeguards     Duty suspensions     Agricultural safeguards     Supplementary units     Credibility checks     Surveillance measures     Common prohibitions and restrictions\n\nThe   member states (HMRC for the UK)\nNational   prohibitions and restrictions     VAT     Excise\n\n        \n      Measure types \u0026 responsibilities post-IP\n\nAfter the IP, there will be a great degree of similarity in the applicable trade measures.\nThe major difference in responsibility will see the MTPO team in DIT’s Trade Policy Group replacing the role of the EU in co-ordinating and maintaining the measures that were previously seen as pan-European.\nThere are a number of other changes too, as per the notes column\nThese groups of measure types are detailed in subsequent pages.\n\n\nMeasure type series\n\nEach measure is associated with a single measure type.\nEach measure type is in turn associated with a single measure type series, in which additional properties of the measure type and its behaviour are stored, and the application logic for the measure types is sequenced.\nThe measure type series are put in place to permit multiple means of overlaying measure types (and hence duties) via combination and exclusion.\n\n\n\n\nIf modifying measure types were considered dangerous, then modifying measure type series is much more dangerous – it is highly recommended that any work that DIT to represent measure types series is to present a read-only view: there should be no capability to manage the measure type series, as the impact is potentially so damaging.\n\n\nMeasure types series - measure type combination field\n\nThe measure type combination field determines how many measure types of a given type series can be applied on a trader’s declaration at any given time to the same context.\nThere are just two valid options:\n\n\n        \n          \nOption\nDescription\n\n0\nOnly   1 measure at export and 1 at import from the series\n\n1\nAll   measure types in the series to be considered\n\n        \n      What this does not mean\n\n\nIf measure type combination is set to 0, this does not mean that Tariff managers can only set up a single measure type from each measure types series in the same context.\n\nWhat this does mean\n\n\nThis does mean that a trader can only take advantage of one measure types from any given series (if combination set to 0).\n\nFor example:\n\n\nThese commodities (8802110010, 8802120010, 8802200010, 8802300010, 8802400010) all have both 103 (Third country duty) and 105 (Non-preferential duty under end-use) applied to the same context1.\nIt is quite possible for a trade agreement to feature both a tariff preference and a preferential quota on the same context (commodity code), but the trader can only call on one of these, not both.\nThe measure type series identifies how different measures are applied alongside or overlaid.\nFor example, you cannot apply multiple measures from the same series (the trader must choose), but multiple measures from different series can be overlaid.\nHence, anti-dumping duties (series D) are overlaid on top of MFN duties (series C) - the to coexist, are additive and do not require selection by the trader.\n\nExisting measure type series\n\n\nThis table is important in understanding how Taric-based border systems apply the measures that DIT has supplied.\nFirstly, the sequence matters – the alphabetical sequence of measure types series is the sequence in which CDS will look to implement the measures.\nTherefore, any complete prohibitions are dealt with first, via measures of type series A (Importation and/or exportation prohibited). If there is a complete prohibition that applies to the specific circumstances of the trade (e.g. the combination of commodity and origin), then that’s that – the trade cannot continue – working out anything else / checking certificates etc is of zero value.\nIf there is no complete prohibition on the trade, then the next step is to work out if the trader has the necessary conditions in place, including certification or licensing, to allow the trade to pass (type series B). Again, if the necessary documentation or other conditions are not met, there calculating the import duty is somewhat academic.\nThese two measure type series apply equally to imports / exports.\n\n\nThirdly, after application of the prohibitions and restrictions, measure type series C is checked (applicable duty)\n\n\nSeries C contains the MFN duties, tariff preferences, all the quotas and all the suspensions – the trader picks one (actively)\nSeries D contains the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties – of these, if there are multiple that apply to a given context (for example both an anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duty on the same code for the same company), then they both apply: the trader does not get to choose the lower.\nSeries E and F contain Meursing duties, then we get to …\nSeries J is the countervailing charge series (officially) – the countervailing charge measure in this group is no longer used (since 2005), leaving just 695 (additional duties) and 696 (additional duties (safeguard)). Safeguards are the exception that prove the rule with regard to applicability duties according to measure type series sequence – this is discussed on the following pages.\nSeries M features measure types associated with agricultural safeguards, not duties (e.g. the SIV, Unit price)\nSkipping N and O (non-duty-related), the next duty-bearing series are VAT and excise (series P and Q), which are applied over and above import duties.\nFinally, series S contains the additional duties required by the agricultural safeguards re: chicken and other poultry goods, which are applied over and above any standard duty from series C.\n\nMeasure types per measure type series\n        \n          \nSeries\nDescription\nMeasures\n#\n\nA\nImportation   and/or exportation prohibited\n277, 278, 481,   485\n3\n\nB\nEntry   into free circulation or exportation subject to conditions\n410, 420, 464, 465, 467, 473, 474, 475, 476,   477, 478,   479, 482, 483, 705,   706, 707, 708, 709, 710, 711, 712, 713, 714, 715, 716, 717, 718, 719, 722,   724, 725, 728, 730, 735, 740, 745, 746, 747, 748, 749, 750, 751, 755, 760,   761,   770, 771, 772, 773, 774, AHC, AIL, ATT, CEX, CHM, COE, COI, CVD, DPO, ECM, EHC, EQC,   EWP, HOP, HSE, IWP, PHC, PRE, PRT, QRC,   SFS\n58\n\nC\nApplicable   duty\n103, 105, 106, 112, 115, 117,   119, 122, 123, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145,   146, 147\n13\n\nD\nAnti-dumping   or countervailing duties\n551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 561,   562, 564, 565, 566, 570\n11\n\nE\nLevies,   export refunds and other agricultural amounts\n674, 680, 681, 683, 684, 685, 686,   687, 688\n1\n\nF\nAdditional   duty on sugar, flour\n672, 673\n2\n\nJ\nCountervailing   charge\n690, 695, 696\n2\n\nM\nUnit   price, standard import value, representative price (poultry, sugar)\n488, 489, 490\n3\n\nN\nPosterior   surveillance\n430, 431,   440, 442,   445, 447,   450, 455, 456, 457, 460, 461, 462, 463, 468, 469, 470, 471, 472\n4\n\nO\nSupplementary   unit\n109, 110\n2\n\nP\nVAT   (HMRC responsibility)\n305, VTA, VTE, VTS, VTZ\n5\n\nQ\nExcises   (HMRC responsibility)\n306, DAA, DAB, DAC, DAE, DAI,   DBA, DBB, DBC, DBE, DBI, DCA, DCC, DCE, DCH, DDA, DDB, DDC, DDD, DDE, DDF,   DDG, DDJ, DEA, DFA, DFB, DFC, DGC, DHA, DHC, DHE, EAA, EAE, EBA, EBB, EBE,   EBJ, EDA, EDB, EDE, EDJ, EEA, EEF, EFA, EFJ, EGA, EGB, EGJ, EHI, EIA, EIB,   EIC, EID, EIE, EIJ, EXA, EXB, EXC, EXD, FAA, FAE, FAI, FBC, FBG, LAA, LAE,   LBA, LBB, LBE, LBJ, LDA, LEA, LEF, LFA, LGJ\n♾\n\nS\nSupplementary   amount\n651, 652, 653, 654,   655, 656, 657, 658\n4\n\n        \n      This table illustrates, per measure series, the measure types that have not been actively end-dated. Bold indicates measures for which there is at last one measure in Jan 2020 (plus the provisional anti-dumping and countervailing duties, which happen to have no measures currently, but remain active).\nContext - what does this mean?\n\nFirst thing to say – this is a useful term invented by the project team: it is not a Taric term, but is a handy short hand for what it actually means\nHere is a Taric sentence that helps to explain context: this is taken from Taric Business Processing rule ME1:\n\n\n\n\nNo two measures that match on all of these fields can coexist – according to this rule, if just one field differs, then a second measure can be inserted.\nIn fact, the stated rule is not as strict as reality – if there is any crossover of period of application (start \u0026 end dates), then the measures will clash.\nIn addition – conflict checking must also apply all the way up and down a commodity code hierarchy – this is explained below in the pages re: ME32\n\n\nThe measure type 696 anomaly\n\nMeasure type 696 is the measure used to impose safeguards on imports of steel from multiple countries around the world, in an attempt to stabilise the flow of steel goods coming into the Union as a result of the USA’s imposition of similar safeguards: the upset to world trade flows caused such a glut of cheep steel to land on EU shores, that the EU had no option other than to follow suit.\nSafeguards are made up of two elements: a 25% safeguard additional duty, and a non-preferential quota, which essentially waives the safeguard.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the additive rules of thumb re: measure type series, it is unclear by what mechanism the quota (type 122) can cancel out the additional duties (safeguard).\nThe understanding is that this must have been achieved via some custom configuration in the border systems.\n\nMeasure type fields\n        \n          \nField\n\n\nmeasure.type.id\nThe unique ID of the measure type, as referenced in the   measure. This is always exactly 3 digits long. For measure types sourced from   the EU, this is a numeric string; for UK national measures (VAT, excise and   national P\u0026R, this is a 3-digit alphabetical string).\n\nvalidity.start.date\nThe date from which a measure type is valid\n\nvalidity.end.date\nThe date on which a measure type is terminated –   suggestion is that this gets left as NULL unless absolutely required to   change\n\ntrade.movement.code\nDetermines if the measure type is intended to be attached   to an import or export (or both). Possible values are:          0        Import – majority of measure types concern import, as the tariff        primarily deals with import      1        Export – most of these are export controls (e.g. sanctions)      2        Import/export – there are very few measure types which are applicable to        both import and export\n\norigin.dest.code\nThis field is an exact duplicate of trade.movement.code   (above), but it is required in Taric. Also, ignore the definition of the   options that are listed in the Taric Elements guide: it is wrong – there are   three options that are possible, as above:          0        Import      1        Export      2        Import/export – (omitted in the Elements guide)\n\npriority.code\nThis appears to be a redundant field, as literally all   EU-sourced measure types have a priority.code of “1” – if we are managing   measure types in the Tariff Application, we should use always set the value   to 1. There are national measure types (set in CHIEF) that have a   priority.code of 5.\n\nmeasure.component.applicable.code\nDetermines if measure components (or measure condition   components) can be attached to this measure type – things like 3rd country   duty (103) and preferential tariff quota (143) require measure components,   whereas things like import / export controls must not have them (e.g.   Veterinary control 410).     This rule needs to be checked when creating measures\n\norder.number.capture.code\nDetermines whether a quota order number should be assigned   to a measure of this type: there are two options:     1 Mandatory – e.g. 122 (Non preferential quota), 143   (Preferential quota)     2 Not permitted – e.g. 142 (Tariff preference)     This rule needs to be checked when creating measures\n\nmeasure.explosion.level\nThis field determines how far down the hierarchy a measure   can be ‘exploded’ according to the less than helpful elements guide.   Essentially this means that the number of digits in the hierarchy to which   measures of this type can be assigned.     Always set this to 10 for import measures and to 8 for   export measures (in declaring exports, traders are only required to declare   at 8 digit level).\n\nmeasure.type.series.id\nThe ID of the series – single alphabetical character; acts   as foreign key into the measure type series table, where additional   properties that relate to the execution of the measure types is set.\n\n        \n      Logical view of measure typesPrimary duty-bearing measures – logical layout\nTrade remedy-related measures – logical layout\nSAD guidance \u0026 credibility checks, monitoring\nAgri measures\n\nWhy there are so many import control measures … ME32\n\n“There may be no overlap in time with other measure occurrences with a goods code in the same nomenclature hierarchy which references the same measure type, geo area, order number, additional code and reduction indicator.

Some commodity codes can have hundreds of measures assigned to them.\n\nWhat a measure is not!The tariff is a sea of intermingled terminologies – terms are used in different senses by different policy areas.\nFor instance, in Trade Remedies, the term ‘measure’ may be synonymous with ‘case’, e.g. an investigation launched by the TRA against multiple companies/countries. In this case, the ‘case’ will of followed through to its conclusion, result in a number of measures, a Tariff would refer to them – in the case of Trade Remedies, this could result in many thousands of Tariff measures.\nA measure is not an overarching policy or specific enactment of that policy: in Tariff terms, that is a regulation.\n\n\nMeasures and Regulations\n\n\n\nmeasure1\n\nMeasure\n\n\n\nmeasure2\n\nMeasure\n\n\n\nmeasure3\n\nMeasure\n\n\n\nmeasure4\n\nMeasure\n\n\n\nRegulation\n\nRegulation\n\n\n\nRegulation--measure1\n\n\n\n\nRegulation--measure2\n\n\n\n\nRegulation--measure3\n\n\n\n\nRegulation--measure4\n\n\n\nThe EU build all of their measures in their Taric application and then export them overnight for common application across all of the 28 member states (including us). This will continue until (at the earliest) Jan 1st 2021.\nMeanwhile, all of the other members states are permitted to manage some aspects that influence trade policy, namely:\n\n\nVAT\nExcise\nNational prohibitions and restrictions\n\n\nThe Tariff is a big relational database centred around the measureThere are training packs dedicated to each of these areas, so this is just a very brief introduction.\n\nMeasure types \u0026 responsibilities\n\nThere are c. 260 measure types in existence prior to the end of the Transition Period (TP).\nSome of these have not been used in some time and can be considered as dead, even if they are not formally terminated on the database.\nc. 80 of these are VAT and excise measures that DIT will never get involved in\nThere remain about 85 measure types that will crop up over the course of the next year and will need to be understood, even if some of these are going to be omitted from the UK tariff (in the first instance).\nThe measure types can be broadly broken in to the following groups, with the table below showing the division of responsibility between the EU and the member states, represented for the UK by HMRC.\n\n\nAfter the Transition Period, there will be a great degree of similarity in the applicable trade measures. The UK is not revolutionising the types of trade measures that are to be imposed.\nThese groups of measure types are detailed in subsequent pages.\n\nNational P\u0026RThere are c. 14 national prohibition and restriction type measures. After the Transition Period, there will be no differentiation between measures formerly provided by the EU and national P\u0026R.\n\n        \n          \nID\nDescription\nMeasure count (Jan 20)\nUK measure type\n\nAHC\nAnimal Health Certificate\n2433\n350\n\nAIL\nHealth and Safety Executive Import Licensing Firearms and Ammunition\n55\n351\n\nATT\nAttestation Document (horticulture and potatoes)\n12\n352\n\nCEX\nDCMS Open General Export Licence\n7\n353\n\nCOE\nHome Office Controlled Drugs (export)\n46\n354\n\nCOI\nHMI Conformity Certificate (fruit and veg) issued in UK\n30\n355\n\nCVD\nCommon Veterinary Entry Document (CVED)\n2176\n356\n\nEQC\nCertificate of Conformity\n34\n357\n\nHOP\nHome Office pre-cursor chemical authorisation\n12\n358\n\nHSE\nHealth and Safety Executive (imports)\n12\n359\n\nPHC\nPhytosanitary Certificate (import)\n174\n360\n\nPRE\nHome Office Pre-cursor chemicals\n86\n361\n\nPRT\nHome Office Controlled Drugs (import)\n405\n362\n\nQRC\nQuarantine Release Certificate\n78\n363\n\n        \n      The CVD measure type is a complete duplicate of measure type 410 (Veterinary control) applied in the Taric measures.\nMeasures and geographical areasThe data model allows a single measure to be attached to a single geographical area.\nIn this context a geographical area can mean:\n\n\na single country (or region1)\na group of countries\n\nThe group of countries may be a formal trading bloc, like the EU or CARIFORUM (Caribbean Trading Nations)\nIn the geography is a group, then individual countries within that group may also be excluded.\nFor example, while Haiti is a part of CARIFORUM (both officially and in the Tariff), it is excluded from all preferential measures of the Caribbean EPA (Economic Partnership Agreement), as it has yet to ratify the treaty.\n\nMeasures and commodity codes\n\nA measure is applied to a single commodity code only\nWhile a trade instrument (FTA, import restriction etc.) may and is likely to cover multiple commodity codes, this results in the creation of many individual measures.\nThe Tariff database employs inheritance to apply measures – there are up to 13 tiers in the commodity code hierarchy.\nIn theory, a measure can be applied at any tier in that hierarchy and inherited down. In practice, measures are very rarely assigned at HS chapter (the first tier in the hierarchy).\nWhile this inheritance is great for accelerating the creation of measures, it brings complexity in terms of business rule adherence.\nA measure cannot exist in a hierarchy in the same context (i.e. same measure type, same comm code tree, same date period, same measure type etc.) more than once.\nSo there is no concept of applying a measure at a higher tier in the database and then having it superseded by a more granular exception in a lower tier – you need to be explicit when assigning measures.\nThus, if  commodity X has 10 children, 9 of which require a 0% duty and 1 of which requires a 50% duty, then you must assign the duties explicitly to all 10 commodities\nSee the commodity code training manual for more information, especially re: business processing rule ME32.\nA commodity code or goods nomenclature item is assigned to a measure via two fields, both of which point to the same data item (goods_nomenclature_item_id and goods_nomenclature_sid).\nWhile a commodity code is fully characterised also by its productline_suffix (in places misspelled as producline_suffix), all measures must be assigned to commodity codes with a productline_suffix of 80, therefore this data would be superfluous on the the measure table.\n\nMeasures and additional codesA measure can be assigned to a single additional code only.\nAs with commodity codes, there are multiple fields used to link the measure to the single additional code:\n\n\nadditional_code_type_id\nadditional_code_id\nadditional_code_sid\n\nUnlike commodity codes, there is no concept of inheritance with additional codes – the code is given meaning solely by the additional code type (single digit); the additional code ID (three digits) is essentially a meaningless sequentially sourced number.\nAn additional code is assigned to a measure for multiple reasons, which could potentially be extended in the future:\n\n\nto reference a specific company which will be assigned anti-dumping or anti-subsidy duties\nto reference the route of ingress into the Union (wheat \u0026 other cereals)\nto reference product usage (e.g. pharmaceutical usage gets a reduced import duty)\nto reference goods pillaged from Syria \u0026 Iraq\nto reference the %age content of sugar, flour or milk fats/solids.\n\nSee the additional codes training manual for more information on why additional codes are used.\nMeasures and time periods\n\nLike most (but not all) objects on the tariff database, measures come with validity_start_date and validity_end_date fields.\nFor measures, validity start dates are mandatory, whereas validity end dates are optional and usually left blank.\nMeasure start dates usually coincide with the start dates of the regulations that engender them, though that is not always the case: the regulation also usually has no end date.\nA measure will have and end date when it is intended to be explicitly end-dated, e.g. a measure related to a quota, where a limited balance is available for a specific period of time, or agri measures which are intended to be updated on a metronomic basis, e.g. unit prices, if we choose to adopt these.\nEven though the Taric business processing rules document states that the measure start date under certain circumstances is optional, it is wrong.\nThe schema requires a measure start date in the format yyyy-mm-dd\n\nValidity start dates and end dates are treated differently in the Tariff.\n\n\nValidity start date means 00:00 at the start of the day\nValidity end date means 00:00 at the end of the day.\nTherefore a measure that starts on Jan 1st and also ends on Jan 1st lasts for a full 24 hours and not zero hours.\nThere is no concept of time in the tariff for ‘Taric’ measures, i.e. those that fit into the normal EU schema, which we are adopting.\nHowever, for VAT and excise, the concept of time has been introduced, as this is required to time changes with budget speeches.\n\nMeasures and regulationsA measure is associated to two sets of regulations, depending on its status. These are referred to as follows:\n\nMeasure-generating regulations:\n\n\nThe measure-generating regulation is mandatory for all measures.\nThis is the regulation that gives measures their legal base. The reference to the measure-generating regulation is split into two fields\n\n\nmeasure_generating_regulation_role\nmeasure_generating_regulation_id\n\n\n\nJustification regulations:\n\n\nThe term “justification” regulation is short-hand for “justification for closing” – it is used to identify the legal base that causes the regulation to be terminated in the EU. The UK does not have a similar kind of legislative function – we will not be using the justification regulation as a way of formally auditing the closure of regulations. But there are business rules that make this piece of data critical.\nA justification regulation is not created when a measure is started unless an end-date is also supplied – however, if an end date is supplied, then the justification regulation is mandatory. If the end-date is not entered, then the justification regulation must not be supplied.\nThe justification regulation must be either:\n\n\nthe measure’s measure-generating regulation, or\na measure-generating regulation, valid on the day after the measure’s (explicit) end date.\n\nWhen we end-date measures in TAP, we always use the measure-generating regulation as the justification regulation.\n\nMeasures and footnotes\n\nIt is possible to apply footnotes to both commodity codes and to measures.\nAs with anything else associated to the measure, the footnote is inherited down to child comm codes – therefore if a measure with a footnote is assigned at HS chapter, then both the measure and the footnote are inherited down to all comm codes in that chapter.\nA footnote is connected to the measure by a linking table (many-to-many) called footnote_association_measures.\nFootnotes are linked to measures for the entirety of the measure’s duration – the association does not have its own start and end dates – which differs from footnotes’ association with commodity codes, which are dated.\n\n\nMeasures and duties\n\nDuties are applicable to some, but not all measures. If the measure type is set up with data on the “measure_component_applicable_code” field of “0” or “1”, then a component may / must be applied. If the value of this field is “2”, then the component is not permitted.\nExamples of where a duty is mandatory are 103 (Third country duty (MFN)) and 142 (Tariff preference)\nExamples of where a duty is not permitted are the majority of the prohibition and restriction measures.\nDuties may be held in one of two places:\n\n\ndirectly assigned to the measure under all circumstances\nconditionally assigned to the measure in certain conditions\n\n\n\nDirectly-assigned duties\n\n\nDirectly-assigned duties are assigned to measures via the measure_components table\nA duty (direct- or conditionally-assigned) is often made up of more than one component, which are sequenced in ascending order, according to their duty_expression ID\n\n\nConditionally-assigned duties\n\n\nConditionally-assigned duties are assigned to measures via the measure_condition_components table, via the measure_conditions table.\nThese state that a certain condition needs to be fulfilled for the duty to apply, e.g. a certain entry price or supply of a certificate.\nThese relationships are described in full in the measure components training manual.\n\nMeasure components and measure condition components\nMeasures, conditions and certificates\n\nA measure can be assigned any number of conditions. These are described in full in the measure conditions training manual, but are used to describe to the border systems:\n\n\nduties that apply under certain circumstances\nborder control restrictions that apply under certain circumstances), such as the imposition of requiring a certificate or another kind of document.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of conditions that can be assigned to a single measure, though the current max (Feb 2020) is 26 conditions.\nPlease see the detailed “measure conditions” guide for a full overview of conditions in all their different flavours.\n\n\nRelationship between measures and quotas\n\nWhile First Come, First Served (FCFS) quotas are entirely separate objects on the database, it is not possible to allow traders to declare against quotas unless there is a quota measure exposing its presence to the trader – all trade instruments that are to be executed in CHIEF or CDS need measures to make them work.\nSimilarly, licensed quotas are operated via measures, though they do not have the additional quota data structures associated with them that are used by FCFS quotas.\n\n\n\n\nThe quota structures are linked to the measures via the use of the ordernumber field. This field takes a 6-digit quota order number and is the same data that is managed in the quota_order_number_id field of the quota_order_number table and similar.\nFor licensed quotas, the data is also entered into this field as a 6-digit code, but always starts ”094”.\n\nModifying measures\n\nIn most cases, making a change to a measure is not actually a case of actually modifying that measure entity, nor the ancillary objects (such as conditions and components).\nMost fundamental changes to a measure are achieved by terminating the measure and replacing with an alternative from the date on which the change is scheduled to happen – otherwise, you run the risk of making changes to measures which have already been active and possibly declared against by traders: to change already live data, e.g. the commodity code or the applicable duties is simply not done.\nLet’s say the action were to change the measure type of a given measure such that it evolves from being a 551 (provisional anti-dumping duty) to being a 552, a final anti-dumping duty (known as definitive anti-dumping on the EU tariff). Though this is a required use case, it would never be a case of just updating the measure type of the existing measure.\nInstead:\n\n\nthe tariff manager would need to provide a date on which to make the change, which should be no earlier than tomorrow\nthe existing measure is terminated on the date before the supplied change date\na new measure, effectively a clone, is created starting on the change date, with the old measure type replaced with the new.\n\nThis applies equally to the measure-generating regulation, the geography to which the measure applies, the applicable duties and conditions.\nIn addition, changing fundamental details of the measure, such as the quota order number or the reduction indicator are to be achieved via replacing the measure.\nIf the user is wanting to modify the assigned footnotes, then there is no need to clone the measure: adding a footnote to the existing measure is fine.\n\nThe stopped flag\n\nThe stopped flag is set to ‘true’ when a regulation ends a measure using a specific function called ‘abrogation’.\nThis both sets the effective end date in the regulation and the stopped flag in the measures table.\nIn the UK we are not using this, however be aware that the stopped flag is mandatory.\nPlease always set the stopped flag to false in all cases.\n\n\nExplosion level\n\nWhile this is a field that pertains to the measure type and not the measure itself, it is worth bringing it up here. The explosion level field can formally take 5 values, as per the XSD to the right, however in practice, only the values “8” and “10” are used.\nThe explosion level indicates how far down the goods classification hierarchy a measure can be assigned and the explosion level corresponds to the significant digits in the comm code. Treating comm codes as being 5 pairs of 2 digits …\n11 12 13 10 00 – 8 significant digits (despite the 8th being a zero)\n11 12 13 14 00 – 8 significant digits\n11 12 13 14 10 – 10 significant digits (despite the 10th being a zero)\n11 12 13 14 15 – 10 significant digits\nMeasures of a measure type that is set to an explosion level of 8 cannot be assigned to the 3rd and 4th of the commodity codes above.\nMeasures of a measure type that is set to an explosion level of 10 can be assigned to literally any commodity code.\nThis impacts business rule ME88 (see below).\n\n\nThe reduction indicator\n\nThis field is used to apply preferential Meursing tables to measures.\nThe field is not mandatory and in most countries is set to null.\nAlternative values are 1 to 6, which specify the reduction level to be applied to Meursing placeholders. \nThis is discussed in the agricultural duties training manual.\n\n\nExport refunds\n\nThe export refund nomenclature was a specific nomenclature used for the refund on the export of some agricultural products. This nomenclature is composed of a CN code linked to a 4-digit code called “Export refund additional code”.\nThis has been abandoned since 2013, so the field export_refund_nomenclature_sid should be set to null in all cases.\n\nEntering dutiesDuty sentence deconstructor\n\nWhile this offers a decent route to ensure that no business rules are contravened, it is problematic in terms of screen space, especially for complex conditions, where multiple duties are dependent on those conditions.\nIn addition, it uses a lot of JavaScript, which is not great for accessibility.\nTherefore the approach was taken to prototype something simpler – the nattily named duty sentence deconstructor.\n\n\n\n\nThis tool is designed to allows you to copy and paste or type any kind of duty string in to a field and have it translated into an actual set of measure components, abided by all the Taric business rules (e.g. only ever using one duty expressions once against a measure).\nThe page is unconnected at the moment, but has tested well, both in terms of its usage by policy team members and in terms of translating strings to components.\nThe tool works via a combination of JavaScript (which is optional) and backend string replacement (in PHP, but easy to replicate in Python).\nThe tool differentiates between supplementary unit measure types and all others – supplementary units expect to receive only a unit and in extremis a measurement unit qualifier [KGM E (per 1,000), KGM C (net of drained weight) and KGM S (of sugar with a yield in white sugar of 92%) are used] very infrequently.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe MFN measure for white chocolate is on of the more complex duties on the EU tariff. The UK is unlikely to use anything so complex, but must be able to handle similar duties, in case we revert to this level of complexity. The duty is as follows:\n\n\n9.10 % + 45.10 EUR / 100 kg\nMAX 18.90 % + 16.50 EUR / 100 kg\n\nIf you copy this into the Duty field, you get a translation of it into the 4 clauses (parts field) and from there into the 4 respective measure components\nMost important thing to note is that actually clauses 1, 3 and 4 are effectively the same duty expression – the tool has worked out not to repeat an existing duty expression, hence 01 becomes 04, which becomes 19, so as to not repeat and break business rule ME43.\nThe validity column is just a check (adding 1, 2, 4 and 8 to make 15) that the expression is valid according to the criteria noted bottom left.\nThe PHP is rough and ready but should be easily interpretable for translation into Python and componentisation.\n\nScreens – measuresSearch for measures\n\n\nThe search screen is vastly cut down in comparison to the existing TAP measure search screen.\nThis is a) to save on development time and b) because much of the functionality has not proven to be particularly useful – the original project delivered the capability to search on anything.\nPerformance is a challenge on search results, as the data needs to be returned from multiple tables, especially re: duties and conditions, and especially where the SQL contains a LIKE clause.\nSearch should be against at least all of the criteria on the screen to the left.\nIn the case of commodity code and regulation, the operator dropdown should include both “is one of” and “starts with” to allow exact matches, stemmed matches and searches against multiple precise items (by request of the policy team).\nUse type ahead on measure type, geography and quota order number fields.\n\nMeasures search results\nSearch results screen is common across most data objects – with measures (and quotas), the most important point to note is that there is no left-hand side filter capability - there is no room, as there is so much data that need to be returned. Search results table must include:\n\n\nView of number of results returned (above and below table)\nLink to export the entire dataset (not just the current page) to CSV\nButton to work with selected measures (both above and below the table)\nTable in GDS table style, but with font size shrunk to 12 point to fit the requisite volume of data.\nTable headers with sort controls, as appropriate (no value in sorting on measure_sid, duties, exclusions, conditions, footnotes, status).\nTooltip controls on table headers where appropriate – on this form especially useful on the conditions column, which is complex\nFor the measure SID column, it must be possible to select all measures, for use in the “work with” functions\nFor each measure, click on the measure_sid column value to navigate to the specific measure\nClick on data in the regulation column to navigate to that regulation.\nClick on data in the type (measure type) column to navigate to that measure type.\nClick on data in the additional code column to navigate to that additional code.\nClick on data in the geography and exclusions column to navigate to that geography.\nClick on data in the QON (Quota order number) column to navigate to that quota order number.\nShow status as icon\nUnder table show paging – this screen grab has been doctored to show only 10 results: suggestion is 100 results per page for measures.\n\nDisplay of complex conditions\nThe data in the conditions column is potentially very complicated and needs to be represented on the search results form – especially with Trade Remedies, the duties may be held in the conditions and this is perhaps the critical piece of information being sought.\nThe colour coding is helpful in separating out the components of a condition, all of which are important to the processing of the data in CDS, Gems and Caesar\nFor each line in the conditions column, this is what is meant:\n\n\nblue – the condition code and sequence number\npurple – the reference price (import price greater than …)\nred – the required certificate\ngreen – the action code\nblack – the applicable duties\n\nNot all elements are likely to occur together – in fact the nature of conditions is such that there will either be a reference price or there will be a requirement for a certificate, not both, as per the example above. Taking the first row, against commodity 85 41 40 90 41 and additional code B845, the following data applies:\n\n\nCondition 1 of type A, which requires certificate D018, in which case the declared subheading is allowed\nCondition 2 of type A, which states that if no certificate is provided, then the declared subheading is not allowed (i.e. the counterpoint to condition 1)\nCondition 1 of type F, which states that if the net free at frontier price (import price) \u003e 0.35 EUR WAT, then apply the duty 0.000%\nCondition 2 of type F, which states that if the net free at frontier price (import price) \u003e 0.248 EUR WAT, then apply the difference between import price and duty up to 0.350%\nCondition 3 of type F, which states that if the net free at frontier price (import price) \u003e 0.0 EUR WAT, then apply the duty 31.300%\n\nExtreme conditions\nView of tooltips for columns that need explaining\n\n\nTwo examples of tooltips where the column data benefits from more explanation – the most important one here is the conditions tooltip, where there is potentially a lot of complex data (as per previous slide).\nYes, this uses colour to indicate meaning, therefore running into some challenge for colour-blind users, however it is not the only indicator of meaning.\n\n\nFootnotes column – can also get very busy\n\nThe image to the above shows the 99 footnotes that currently apply to the import of various dual use goods into the EU.\nThe import control team should eventually review the complexity of this and reduce, however it is unlikely to happen for day one.\nKey user needs\n        \n          \nAs a …\nI want to…\nSo that …\nNotes\n\nTariff   Manager\nview   a list of existing measures\nI   can select and decide the next appropriate actions to be performed.\nMust   Have\n\nTariff   Manager\ncreate   a new (single) measure\nI   can keep both the Tariff Application and the downstream border systems up to   date with the latest trade position.\nMust   Have\n\nTariff   Manager\ncreate   new measures in bulk\nI   can keep both the Tariff Application and the downstream border systems up to   date with the latest trade position.\nMust   Have\n\nTariff   Manager\nedit   the properties of an existing measure      -description     -start   date     -end   date     -duties     -geographical   areas     -etc.\nI   can update the changes imposed and also be sent to the relevant external   systems.\nMust   Have\n\nTariff   Manager\nterminate   an existing measure, either individually or in bulk\nthe   measure will not be imposed on the relevant external systems.\nMust   Have\n\nTariff   Manager\nhave   a workflow process\nAll   measure changes can be validated and approved before being sent to CDS.\nMust   Have\n\nTariff   Manager\nhave   a search filter\nI   can find the measures I need quickly.\nMust   Have\n\n        \n      Key business rules\n        \n          \n#\nRule\nNotes\n\nME1\nThe combination of measure type + geographical area +   goods nomenclature item id + additional code type + additional code + order   number + reduction indicator + start date must be unique.\nRequired – extremely high priority     This is actually an understatement of the business rule.   There must be no crossover in dates (start or end date) of measures that shar   the same context (as described by the fields to the left). It is more than   just the start date. This and ME32 can be handled together: develop ME32 and   ME1 falls into place.\n\nME2\nThe measure type must exist.\nRequired – low priority     Measure types will need to be selected from a dropdown   (typeahead), but this should be checked nonetheless\n\nME3\nThe validity period of the measure type must span the   validity period of the measure.\nRequired – low priority     Any date related business rule should be avoided by the   Tariff managers simply not end-dating things – there is no real need to   end-date a measure type, and this should be reasserted.\n\nME4\nThe geographical area must exist.\nRequired – low priority     As per the measure type, this should be avoided by   selecting from a list, however this should be checked.\n\nME5\nThe validity period of the geographical area must span the   validity period of the measure.\nRequired – low priority     As per the measure type check, this is required, but can   be avoided by not end-dating geographical areas (which is unnecessary).\n\nME6\nThe goods code must exist.\nRequired – high priority     Required – this should be checked on first entering the   commodity codes (goods code, commodity code, good nomenclature item id are   all synonymous)\n\nME7\nThe goods nomenclature code must be a product code; that   is, it may not be an intermediate line.\nRequired – high priority     This means that the commodity code must exist with a product   line suffix of “80” and not any other value which would reflect the fact that   the commodity is an intermediate heading and nothing more.\n\nME8\nThe validity period of the goods code must span the   validity period of the measure.\nRequired – high priority     This is one of the more critical rules – commodity   codes do start and end on a regular basis and there must be no commodity   codes that terminate before the end date of the assigned measure(s).     This applies equally to open-ended measures on   commodity codes that are end-dated. If a commodity code is being end-dated,   and there will be a requirement to do so, then any measures against that   commodity code must also be terminated.\n\nME88\nThe level of the goods code, if present, cannot exceed the   explosion level of the measure type.\nRequired – medium priority     This is primarily aimed at export control measures,   which are set at 8-digits rather than at the 10-digits that are reserved for   import measure types. Explosion level is set against the measure type, and   not the measure itself. If the user attempts to assign a measure to a   10-digit commodity when the explosion level is set to 8, then ME88 will be   triggered (see page earlier in deck re: explosion level).\n\nME16\nIntegrating a measure with an additional code when an   equivalent or overlapping measures without additional code already exists and   vice-versa, should be forbidden.\nRequired – high priority     This mostly impacts trade remedies, but also EU   additional code types (most of which will not carry forward), such as route   of ingress additional codes (see separate guide). What this means is that, if   there are measures set up against a combination of a commodity code and an   additional code, then it is not permitted to set up a measure against just   that commodity code (without the additional code).     For instance – a Trade Remedy is in place, where this   has involved creating an anti-dumping measure against a commodity code   (0102030405) and an additional code (C233 – Shanghai Industries). The duty   has been set to 25% (punitive specifically against Shanghai Industries).     It must not be possible to set up a measure for the   same time period, of the same type against just comm code 0102030405 with no   additional code. Border systems do not like ambiguity. Instead, the   additional codes presented for that context must cover the full universe of   options – e.g. residual (All other companies A999, B999, C999) codes are set   up for Trade Remedies.\n\nME115\nThe validity period of the referenced additional code must   span the validity period of the measure\nRequired – medium priority     As with all similar rules, this needs to be checked but   should rarely if ever come up, as Tariff Managers should not be end-dating   additional codes.\n\nME25\nIf the measure’s end date is specified (implicitly or   explicitly) then the start date of the measure must be less than or equal to   the end date.\nRequired – low priority     Should be checked as soon as the dates are entered into   the application. End date will in almost all circumstances by empty (Null)   for measures.\n\nME32\nThere may be no overlap in time with other measure   occurrences with a goods code in the same nomenclature hierarchy which   references the same measure type, geo area, order number, additional code and   reduction indicator. This rule is not applicable for Meursing additional   codes.\nRequired – extremely high priority     This is the mother of all business rules and the one   that is likely to trip DDaT and Tariff Managers up more than any other. This   is an extension of the previously described ME1 to all commodity codes in the   upward hierarchy and all commodity codes in the downward hierarchy.     Therefore it is critical that the development team   works out a way of identifying a commodity’s hierarchy from the available   data. There is no concept of parent / child relationship in the database,   rather a list of sequential numbers and indents which infer the hierarchy.     This business rule is detailed on the next pages and in   the section on import control measures. There are 40+ import control   measures, all of which do broadly one of two things: prohibit goods entirely   from being traded, or require that certain provisions are taken (e.g.   documentation). There are so many measure types precisely to avoid ME32.     See next page for details…\n\n        \n      ME32 and Jams, fruit jellies, marmalades\n\n\n\nAs a tariff manager, I have been asked to create a new measure for ERGA OMNES of type “Import control” at level 4 “with a sugar content exceeding 30% by weight” – \nThere is already a measure of type “Import control” at level 8 “Fruit purees obtained by sieving then brought to the boil in a vacuum, the texture and chemical composition of which have not been changed by the heat treatment”\nME32 says no\nI can either rejig the measures in the entire hierarchy to suit to new measure OR …\nI can invent a new measure type “Import control for sieved fruit puree” … which is what the EU has done, and which we will also need to do in the future.\n\n[have not included ‘create new measures’ section - pages 60-88 in powerpoint]\n\n","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-data-structures/measures.html"},"14":{"title":"Measure components","content":"Measure components\n\n\nIntroduction to measure components\n\n\n\n\nTypes of duty\n\n\nIntroduction to measure components\n\n\nBreaking down a duty string\n\n\nIntroduction to duty expressions\n\n\nDuty expression sequencing \u0026 duality\n\n\nGrouping duty expressions\n\n\nAbout measurement units\n\n\nAbout measurement unit qualifiers\n\n\nManaging duties in TAP II\n\n\nSupplementary units\n\n\n\n\nMeasure component data structures\n\n\nMeasure condition components\n\n\nKey business processing rules\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasure components are duties that are applied to tariff measures, not all measures have duties associated with them.\n\nIntroduction to measure components\n\nMeasure components basically equate to duties applied to tariff measures.\nNot all tariff measures have duties associated with them – for instance measures of type 103, 142 or 143 (third country duty, tariff preference and preferential tariff rate quota) require duties, but for others, e.g. 277 Import prohibition, measure components are not permitted.\nThe screen grab to the right shows the duties / measure component column on the UK Trade Tariff service.\n\n\nTypes of dutyBroadly speaking, there are three kinds of duties that can be applied to a measure:\n\n\nAd valorem duty, for example 0.00% or 3.60% (a percentage additional duty applied to the import duty of the goods)\nSpecific duty, for example 4.200 EUR / KGM or 110.00 EUR / LTR (an import duty that is dependent on the weight / volume of goods being imported and not just the import price)\nCompound duty – a combination of the above ad valorem and compound types, e.g. 3.60% + 110 EUR / LTR\n\nIn addition, there are ‘conjunctions’ which join multiple ‘clauses’ within the duty sentence, as follows:\nMin (down to a minimum of …)\nMax (up to a maximum of …)\nFourthly, there are duty placeholders that are used to manage Meursing code inserts for complex agri-foods – though this is not a policy that the UK intends to take forward after the implementation period, it is worth bearing this in mind – this is explained in a separate document “Meursing codes”\nFinally, there are is a concept called “Supplementary units” which is dealt with in the ”Measurements” document but referenced here.\nIntroduction to measure components\n\nA measure component is the term used in tariff management to describe the elements that make up a tariff duty.\nThe example to the right shows a screen grab of a page from the Trade Tariff Service for ‘white chocolate’\nThis is a deliberately extreme example, as the duties applied to the import of white chocolate into the European Union illustrate a number of the concepts behind management of duties and measure components.\nThe full duty applicable to the import of white chocolate (1704903000) is as follows:\n9.10 % + 45.10 EUR / 100 kg MAX 18.90 % + 16.50 EUR / 100 kg\nThis is a ferociously complex duty that is a pair of compound duties joined together by a MAX conjunction\nThe next slide illustrates how this is broken into multiple measure components.\n\n\nBreaking down a duty string\n\ngraph “Measures” {\n  rankdir=LR\n  node [shape=box]\nmeasure1 [label=Measure component]\n  measure2 [label=Measure component]\n  measure3 [label=Measure component]\n  measure4 [label=Measure component]\n“Measure” – measure1\n  “Measure” – measure2\n  “Measure” – measure3\n  “Measure” – measure4\n}\nIntroduction to duty expressions\n\n\nThe table lists all of the possible duty expressions that can be used.\nThe duty expression indicates to the border system how to treat the values that are attributed to the other columns in the measure_component table.\nAlthough there are 32 listed, very few of these are used on a regular basis. The ones that are used regularly are highlighted in yellow.\nThose highlighted in green are massively prevalent right now in the EU tariff, but are expected to fall away in the UK tariff after the implementation period (Meursing codes).\nThe numbers of the duty expression IDs are essentially arbitrary, but they imbue meaning that is shared across Taric-based systems.\nThey are immutable – we cannot change or append to these and we cannot delete any unless we want to cause significant heartache for the CDS team in HMRC.\n\nDuty expression sequencing \u0026 duality\n\nGrouping duty expressions\n        \n          \nRequirement\nUse duty expression …\n\nTo   add an ad valorem duty or specific duties …\n01,   04, 19 and 20\n\nTo   add an ad valorem duty or specific duties after a MAX clause\n17   and 35\n\nTo   add an ad valorem duty or specific duties after a MIN clause\n15\n\nTo   add a Meursing placeholder …\n12,   14, 21, 25, 27 and 29\n\nTo   add a supplementary unit\n99\n\n        \n      And that’s pretty much it. It is not up to you to choose which of the grouped duty expressions to use:\n* use 01 in all occasions for an ad valorem duty or specific duties …\n* unless there is a compound duty, in which case use 01 followed by 04\n* etc.\nWhite chocolate’s duty string contains four elements, as per the measure components:\n\n\n9.10 % - a simple ad valorem (duty expression 01)\n45.10 EUR / 100 kg – a specific duty (duty expression 04)\nMAX 18.90 % - a simple ad valorem (again), introduced by a Max conjunction (duty expression 17)\n16.50 EUR / 100 kg – a second specific duty (duty expression 19)\n\nOn the previous slide, we describe the duty expressions 01, 04 and 19 (and 20) as being functionally identical, however, they display differently – this is solely down to the other values in the table row.\n\nSimply speaking, follow these rules of thumb for standard duty expressions (excluding Meursing and supplementary units):\n\n\nif there is a value set in the monetary unit code column, then we are looking at a specific duty; if there is no value in this column then this is an ad valorem duty. This is why the duty expression description is ”% or amount”\nthe monetary unit will always be EUR (Euros)\nif the monetary unit is specified, then the measurement unit must also be specified: you cannot have a specific duty that requires the importer to pay €x per … \nif the measurement unit is specified, you may also apply a qualifier – this is not mandated and is in fact quite uncommon, but is used to specify measurement units such as “kilogramme net weight” or ”kilogramme gross weight” etc.\nThe measurement unit qualifiers can only be applied to certain pre-mandated measurement units.\n\nAbout measurement units\n\n\nThe tables above identify the measurement units that can be used.\nAs with many of the Taric objects, there is a lot of historical content that has not been used for some time.\nThe yellow highlighted cells are those measurement units that have been used in the past 10 years\nIt may be appropriate to hide the less recently used measurement units from tariff managers.\nThe IDs of these units are not always especially self-explanatory\nPay special attention to NAR, which is very commonly used. Presumably, this is a German abbreviation (e.g. Nummer Artikeln), but it means number of items. To confuse even more, on the Trade Tariff Service and on the EU Taric Consultation, this is referred to as “p/s” (which stands for pièces / Stücke (items in FR / DE). Finally number of items is often referred to as “heads”, when referencing livestock, e.g. cattle especially in quotas. You have been warned.\n\nAbout measurement unit qualifiers\n\n\nThe table to above identifies the measurement unit qualifiers that can be used. Those highlighted in yellow are those that have been used since Jan 2021.\nThe table below is used to identify which qualifiers can be used alongside which measurement codes. It’s vital that the TAP interface does not allow any combination of unit and qualifier not specified in the measurements table.\n\n\n        \n          \nMeasurement unit\nDescription\nMeasurement unit qualifier\nDescription\n\nASV\n%vol\nX\nHectolitre\n\nDTN\nHectokilogram\nE\nnet of drained weight\n\nDTN\nHectokilogram\nF\nof common wheat\n\nDTN\nHectokilogram\nG\nGross\n\nDTN\nHectokilogram\nL\nof live weight\n\nDTN\nHectokilogram\nM\nnet of dry matter\n\nDTN\nHectokilogram\nR\nof the standard quality\n\nDTN\nHectokilogram\nS\nof sugar with a yield in white sugar of 92%\n\nDTN\nHectokilogram\nZ\nper 1% by weight of sucrose\n\nKGM\nKilogram\nA\nTotal alcohol\n\nKGM\nKilogram\nE\nnet of drained weight\n\nKGM\nKilogram\nG\nGross\n\nKGM\nKilogram\nP\nof lactic matter\n\nKGM\nKilogram\nS\nof sugar with a yield in white sugar of 92%\n\nKGM\nKilogram\nT\nof dry lactic matter\n\nLTR\nLitre\nA\nTotal alcohol\n\nMTQ\nCubic meter\nC\n1 000\n\nNAR\nNumber of items\nB\nper flask\n\nTNE\nTonne\nE\nnet of drained weight\n\nTNE\nTonne\nI\nof biodiesel content\n\nTNE\nTonne\nJ\nof fuel content (usually in form of tallow, stearin, paraffin wax or   other waxes, including the wick)\n\nTNE\nTonne\nK\nof bioethanol content\n\nTNE\nTonne\nM\nnet of dry matter\n\nTNE\nTonne\nR\nof the standard quality\n\nTNE\nTonne\nZ\nper 1% by weight of sucrose\n\n        \n      Managing duties in TAP II[may be moved to a different section so have not included it yet]\nSupplementary unitsOn most occasions, when a trader is declaring their goods for import, they are mandated to declare the weight of their goods in kilogrammes (KGM).\nHowever, there are times where this is not the measurement required – common measurement types might be “number of items” for livestock, volume in litres for liquid items, “number of pairs” for socks etc. (really).\nOn such an occasion the trader is asked to complete box 41 on the SAD form (below) – the trader must enter the numeric value and the supplementary unit, e.g. 247 items (NAR) or 15,000 litres of pure alcohol (LPA).\n\nThe supplementary units are the same measurement units as described previously in this document. They are set up in the Tariff as follows – they are measures like any other:\nStep 1 – create a measure of type 109 or 110\n\n\nuse 109 typically as this is a x-purpose measure type used for both imports and exports\ntype 110 is used solely for imports\nthere is also a type 111 for exports: it is never used \n\nStep 2 – create a measure component\n\n\nuse 99 as the duty expression ID\nset the measurement unit code field to whichever measurement unit is to be used\nyou may also set a measurement qualifier unit, however this is extremely rare.\n\nMeasure component data structures\nMeasure condition components\nMeasure conditions may be attached to conditions instead of to measures themselves.\nIt is important that one does not double up and apply measure condition components AND measure components - this will break the business processing rules of Taric and fail to load on CDS.\nThe data structures concerning measure condition components are almost identical to those for measure components – the only real difference being that they are attached to the condition and not the measure itself.\nKey business processing rules\n        \n          \n#\nDescription\nNotes\n\nME40\nIf the flag “duty expression” on measure type is   “mandatory” then at least one measure component or measure   condition component record must be specified.    If the flag is set “not permitted” then no measure component or   measure condition component must exist.    Measure components and measure condition components are mutually exclusive. A   measure can have either components or condition components (if the ‘duty   expression’ flag is ‘mandatory’ or ‘optional’) but not both.\nRequired     This describes the fact that measures of certain types   MUST have components (duties) assigned to them, whereas others must not.     Please note the sub-clause also – if the value of the   field “Component applicable” is set to 1 (Mandatory) on a measure type, then   when the measure is created, there must be either measure components or   measure condition components assigned to the measure, but not both. CDS will   generate errors if either of these conditions are not met.\n\nME41\nThe referenced duty expression must exist.\nRequired     There is a specified list of duty expressions that can be   used in TAP / CDS. We must not use any duty expressions that are not valid.\n\nME42\nThe validity period of the duty expression must span the   validity period of the measure.\nRequired     There are a number of duty expressions that are no longer   valid – they have been end dated (in 1996 and 2016 primarily). We must not   use these.\n\nME43\nThe same duty expression can only be used once with the   same measure.\nRequired     Even if an expression that (in English) reads the same needs   to be used more than once in a measure, we must use a different expression   ID, never the same one twice.\n\nME45\nIf the flag “amount” on duty expression is   “mandatory” then an amount must be specified. If the flag is set   “not permitted” then no amount may be entered.\nRequired     The three possible values for this field on the   duty_expressions table are:     0 - Permitted     1 - Mandatory     2 - Not permitted     These values must be observed – By the way, we should not   allows users to modify the data associated with duty expressions, as the   knock on impact will be too significant.\n\n\nDescription\nNotes\n\nME46\nIf the flag “monetary unit” on duty expression   is “mandatory” then a monetary unit must be specified. If the flag   is set “not permitted” then no monetary unit may be entered.\nRequired     The three possible values for this field on the   duty_expressions table are:     0 - Permitted     1 - Mandatory     2 - Not permitted     These values must be observed – As above, we should not   allows users to modify the data associated with duty expressions.\n\nME47\nIf the flag “measurement unit” on duty   expression is “mandatory” then a measurement unit must be   specified.

Measurements have start and end dates against them, and these also   need to be observed.\n\nME51\nThe validity period of the measurement unit must span the   validity period of the measure.\nRequired     Measurement units have start dates end dates – we need   to observe these start and end dates in the creation of measures. We are not   offering a tool to manage measurement units in the first instance.\n\nME52\nThe validity period of the measurement unit qualifier must   span the validity period of the measure.\nRequired     Measurement unit qualifiers have start dates end dates   – we need to observe these start and end dates in the creation of measures.   We are not offering a tool to manage qualifiers in the first instance.\n\n\nDescription\nNotes\n\nME53\nThe referenced measure condition must exist.\nRequired     All measure condition components are referenced back to   the measure_condition that engenders them and not the measure itself.\n\nME54\nThe validity period of the referenced measure condition   must span the validity period of the measure.\nNot required - disregard     As far as we can see, this is an erroneous business   rule: the measure condition table does not have a start and end date field.   The condition adopts the start and end dates of the parent measure.   Similarly, there are no start and end dates associated with a measure   condition component (or for that matter a measure component). They all adopt   the date constraints of the parent measure.\n\nME55\nA measure condition refers to a measure condition or to a   condition + certificate or to a condition + amount specifications.\nDisregard     This has been written so vaguely that there are no   rules to be gleaned from it\n\nME60\nThe referenced monetary unit must exist.\nRequired      Conditions are put in place to respond either to the   provision of some sort of document / license or to respond to a minimum   threshold import price – if the latter then there is a requirement to specify   a valid monetary unit, which is always likely to be GBP.\n\nME61\nThe validity period of the referenced monetary unit must   span the validity period of the measure.\nRequired - debatable     The unit will always be GBP or EUR – all we need to do   is to ensure that the units are not end-dated\n\n\nDescription\nNotes\n\nME105\nThe referenced duty expression must exist.\nRequired     Notes as per measure components\n\nME106\nThe VP of the duty expression must span the VP of the   measure.\nRequired     Notes as per measure components\n\nME108\nThe same duty expression can only be used once within   condition components of the same condition of the same measure.

needs\n\n\nKey business rules\n\n\n\n\nQuota suspensions invalidate a quota; during the suspension period the suspended First Come First Serve (FCFS) quotas are unavailable to traders.\n\nBackground to Quotas\n\n\nA quota provides an opportunity for an importer to import goods at a rate that is lower than the prevailing MFN (or preferential rate) until the specified volume of goods has run out (or exhausted).\nOnce the volume has exhausted, the quota is no longer available and the out-of-quota-rate is then payable.\nA quota can be managed via two regimes, as follows: First Come First Served (FCFS) and Licensed.\n\n\n\n\nQuota suspensions are applicable only to First Come First Serve quotas\n\nWhat are quota suspensions?\n\n\nQuota suspensions are functions that are enabled in legal text to allow for First Come First Serve quotas to be made effectively unavailable to traders for a given period of time, for a number of reasons – these reasons are typically written into the initial legal text, such that there is no requirement to legislate to bring in the suspension.\nSome typical reasons are as follows:\n\n\nThe administrative costs of running the quota mean that there is no value in doing so while the MFN rate is equal to or lower than the in-quota rate – for example, the image to the below is a fragment of EU regulation “2016/1219, amending Council Regulation (EC) No 499/96 as regards Union tariff quotas for certain fish and fishery products originating in Iceland” – the footnote explains why the quota is suspended from 15 Feb to 15 June.\ne.g. for fishing quotas, a quota is applicable only while overall catch volumes do not exceed a given amount.\n\n\n\nLogical model of a quota suspension\n\n\n\nUsing the herrings example from the previous page, quota 09.0792 runs annually from January 1st to December 31st and is applied to commodity code 0303510000.\nThe MFN is 15.00% all year round, except for the period between Feb 15th and June 15th, where it is 0.00% (tariff free)\nThe EU has chosen to suspend the quota for the period where the MFN is zero, as there is no value in running a quota when there is no material gain to be made for the trader in applying for quota usage during that period.\n\nWhen is a quota not a quota?\nA quota suspension can be thought of as an antidote to a quota; a nullification of its effects; during the period of the suspension, it is as if the quota is not there; a trader cannot request an allocation against that quota and it is invisible on the Trade Tariff Service, as follows:\nFor 1st July 2019, after the suspension, the quota is visible https://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/commodities/0303510010?currency=EUR\u0026day=1\u0026month=7\u0026year=2019#import\n\nFor 1st March, during the suspension, the quota is hiddenhttps://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/commodities/0303510010?currency=EUR\u0026day=1\u0026month=7\u0026year=2019#import\nIt is important to note however that there a many ways to skin a cat: in this example, the EU has also made the quota measures last from 16th June to 14th Feb and not all year long.\nSimplified quotas data model (as applies to suspension periods)\n\nA quota order number is made up of many quota definition periods\nWhen setting up quotas, it’s important to understand that a single quota order number record is made up of many definition periods: these periods may be of any length (no longer than a year, with the most typical lengths being annual and quarterly, as well as a number of custom periods, especially re: agricultural goods \u0026 seasonal marketing periods).\n\nQuota suspension data object in detail\nThe quota suspension object is not one of the more complex objects in the database: there are few fields, in fact there are only three that you need to actively define.\n\n\n        \n          \n\nField\n\nDescription\n\n\nquota_suspension_period_sid\n\nUnique   identifier, automatically generated by the application when a new suspension   period is created – you do no create this yourself\n\n\nquota_definition_sid\n\nThe   quota definition to which the suspension is to be attached – you do not need   to enter the ID of the definition: you select it from a list (as will be   demonstrated)\n\n\nsuspension_start_date\n\nThe   start date of the suspension blocking period – i.e. 00:00 at the start of the   chosen day\n\n\nsuspension_end_date\n\nThe   end date of the suspension blocking period – i.e. 00:00 at the end of the   chosen day\n\n\ndescription\n\nAn   optional field, up to 500 characters in length, that helps to define the   suspension and the reasons for it: the EU has been deeply unhelpful /   non-descriptive in its suspension descriptions and we may choose to be more   expressive post-EU Exit\n\n        \n      \nA suspension period must fit within a definition period\nThe critical point is that a quota suspension is defined against a quota definition period: the suspension period MUST NOT straddle the boundary of the definition – in the rare occasion you need to straddle a boundary, create 2 suspension\n\nDates on TAP\n\n\nA reminder from the main training manual that there is a peculiarity that should be surfaced with regard to dates on TAP.\nMost objects on the database are bookended by start dates and end dates.\nFor measures, quota definitions, geographical areas and most other data objects, these dates are referred to in the database as “validity start and end dates”.\nQuota suspensions periods and blocking periods are also bookended, but they break the otherwise universal rule in terms of naming fields, choosing instead:\n\n\nsuspension_start_date and suspension_end_date\nblocking_start_date and blocking_end_date\n\nFor all of these date ranges, the same rules apply, namely:\n\n\nwe work on dates and not times: a single day is the smallest unit of time\nfor start dates, the actual ‘start’ is defined as being 00:00 at the start of the day\nfor end dates, the actual ‘end’ is defined as being 00:00 at the end of the day\ntherefore, if the start and end dates of a given object are identical, this equates to a whole 24 hours and not to 0 hours\nTHIS CANNOT BE STRESSED ENOUGH, and is critical to the use of suspension periods.\n\n\nManaging suspension periods on TAP[Not yet sure if this will go in a different section so I have omitted

Quotas\n\n\nIn-depth view of data tables\n\n\nLicensed quotas\n\n\nQuota user needs\n\n\nQuota business rules\n\n\n\n\nA quota is used to control quantities of particular goods being imported.\n\nIntroduction to quotas\n\nA quota is used as a means of controlling the flow of goods into a country in order to create a balance between:\n\n\nthe needs of consumers or manufacturing industries that would use the item as a component or ingredient in producing something else in the importing countries and\ndomestic producers of the good, whose livelihood depends on producing and selling a product to domestic customers at full market price.\n\nFor example, tomatoes are imported into the European Union from Mediterranean countries and other places with temperate climates in order to satiate the needs of European citizens for tomatoes and sauces containing tomatoes. In Southern Europe, there are tomato growers for whom the overseas suppliers are rivals that threaten their livelihood.\nIn the UK, sheep farmers depend on selling their goods to a UK market hungry for lamb and lamb products; but there is not enough lamb in the UK to satisfy our needs, hence the need to import lamb from New Zealand and other countries.\nThis is a fine balance that needs to be managed carefully in order to support the needs of the two contrasting needs: the need for the nation to consume and need for domestic suppliers to make a living.\nThis is where quotas come in.\n\n\nGet to know Peter Ungphakorn\n\n\nPeter Ungphakorn was a senior information officer with the WTO Secretariat until 2015.\nSince then he has moved into journalism, focusing mainly on international trade rules, agreements and institutions and fortunately making his knowledge available to the public via his Trade Beta Blog.\nThis blog contains very good, simple explainers (for seven and a half year-olds) on a number of topics, including quotas.\n\n\n\n\nRead above about Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs) (less so quantitative restrictions)\nSee also his blog on Meursing tables which simplifies an incredibly complex subject.\n\nWhat is a quota?\n\n\nA quota allows a certain volume of goods to be imported into a country at a reduced duty rate.\nOnce that volume has been imported, then the quota is considered to be exhausted and is no longer available to draw down against.\nAt that point, all importers will be forced to import the goods at the full (or less preferential duty rate).\n\n\nWhat properties does a quota have?\n\n\nReturning to the lamb quota on the previous screen, clicking on the term “092016” shows more detail of the quota.\n“092016” is the quota order number. If any trader wants to take advantage of the preferential duties associated with a quota, then they need to quote that 6-digit quota order number on their import declaration. A quota1 has properties such as those shown here\nThese properties are described on the following pages\n\n\nDefining quotas\nThere are multiple ways of defining and grouping quotas, all of which will be relevant to the delivery of the next iteration of the Tariff Application:\n\n\nAdministration mechanism:\n\n\nFirst come first served \nLicensed\n\nLegislative mechanism:\n\n\nWTO quota\nATQ\npreferential quota as part of an FTA \nsafeguard quota\n\nOrigin quota: \n\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\nIf you were to draw a Venn-style diagram of how these slices fit together, it would look a bit like this:\n\nPreferential vs Non-Preferential quotas\nPreferential quotas\n\n\nThe term preferential means that a single country or bloc is afforded treatment that provides better market access / lower duties than other countries.\nIn practical terms, preferential tariff duties and quotas are almost always made available via (Free) Trade Agreements. The quota is agreed as part of the bilateral negotiation between the two parties that provides each with mutual benefits.\nPreferential quotas are always applied at a specific country or small group of countries.\nWithin the EU, there are a very small number of quotas which are applied to multiple countries (e.g. a wine quota available for imports from multiple W. Balkan countries), but most are aimed explicitly at one country or bloc.\nAmong the few exceptions, Greenland benefits from preferential quotas on seafoods outside of a formal Trade Agreement\n\nNon-Preferential quotas\n\n\nNon-preferential quotas are aimed at maintaining the balance of trade flows on critical goods by opening up a specific volume of market access to all overseas nations – in most cases, the non-preferential quotas are assigned to ERGA OMNES1 (the country group that includes all countries).\nThere are very few officially non-preferential quotas that have been opened up to specific countries only, where there is a need to maintain global trade flows with a less blunt instrument than a global non-preferential quota applied to the entire world, especially where there are trade titans in a particular commodity\nLamb is again a great example of this – there is a non-preferential quota for Erga Omnes (small volume) and much larger non-prefs for specific countries like Chile, Australia and New Zealand – each of which is a dominant player in the lamb trade.\n\nWays of administering quotas\nThere are two methods of administering a quota:\nFirst Come First Served quotas\n\n\nThese are by far the most common of the two types of quota.\nAs the name suggests, a FCFS quota involves making a pot available to traders: whoever claims against that pot first gets to take advantage of the reduced rate.\nIf you’re not quick enough, you miss the opportunity and pay the non-preferential rate.\n\nLicensed quotas\n\n\nThe purpose of a licensed quota is the same as a FCFS quota: to protect the fine balance of trade flows, however the mechanism for applying for usage is very different.\nFor each quota, periods of the year are opened up for importers to apply for licenses from the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) - a division of Defra.\nDuring this period, the RPA accepts these license requests and issues licenses according to the specific rules of the quota\nIn the EU tariff, all licensed quotas’ 6-digit quota order numbers begin with “094”.\n\nOrigin quotas\nSome quotas identify as Origin Quotas (about 25%)\nOrigin quotas allow for specific quantities of some products to receive preferential tariff treatment if the products meet certain conditions, for example a proof of origin can be provided to prove that the goods do in fact come from the specific country.\nOrigin quotas are always preferential in nature.\nFor a good example of an origin quota, please see the cat \u0026 dog food quota in place with Canada, where a proof of origin certificate is explicitly required.\n\nThe reason why this is important is that a quota’s origin status is displayed on the reference documents that accompany a trade agreements (as a schedule to the primary SI).\nWTO quotas\n\n\nThe UK declares a tariff “schedule of concessions” to the WTO which is made up of multiple elements – what interests us most here is:\nthe tariff schedule\nthe schedules for tariff quotas on agricultural and non-agricultural products\nThe quota schedules list the concessions that we will make to overseas nations to provide greater market access to our market than would have been afforded by adopting the MFN rate alone.\nIn most cases, WTO quotas are assigned to the whole world (ERGA OMNES), but in certain cases (e.g. with lamb), the quota concessions are made available to individual countries which major in a certain trade (e.g. New Zealand for lamb).\nAlmost all WTO quotas are agricultural goods (this also applies to the other kinds of quota).\n\n\nAutonomous quotas (ATQs)\n\n\nAutonomous quotas are represented in the tariff as simple “Non-preferential quotas”. These are particularly applicable within the fishing industry. There is contention within the fishing industry between the catching sector and the food and processing sector.\nFor highly consumed goods, such as cod, pollock and prawns, the UK / EU catching industry cannot catch sufficient product to satisfy the needs of the home and international market. Therefore the processing industry needs access to low or zero duty for such products, while the catching industry needs protection by retaining at least some maximum import threshold above which normal tariff duties apply.\nThe autonomous tariff rate quota (ATQ) facilitates this compromise – a quantity of goods can be imported into the EU at zero or low rate, until exhausted, at which point the duty reverts to the third country rate\nATQs are set on a three year cycle: the ATQ duty rate cannot be changed in the course of that 3 year cycle, however the starting balance for each year can be assessed at the start of each year.\nFor fisheries ATQs, there is an additional point of interest, that, if 80% or more of the quota has been exhausted by the end of September in any given year, then the balance of the quota is increased by 20%\nAutonomous Quotas so called, as the EU unilaterally decides to open a quota – there is no requirement for recourse to WTO approval to open an ATQ.\nIt is anticipated that the ATQs will continue to operate post-Brexit as they are favoured within the Defra ministry and offer a compromise to the different parts of the industry.\n\nWhat products are covered by quotas?\n\nIdentifying quota types\n\n\nUnfortunately, it is not a simple matter to take a quota order number and determine what kind of quota is being used. In the EU Tariff:\n\n\nAll current EU quota order numbers begin with 09 without exception\n“094” means licensed quota\nAutonomous agriculture quotas begin 0977\nAutonomous fisheries quotas begin 0987\n\nApart from that, there are few obvious rules that define the EU’s use of quotas.\nThe system for identifying quotas in the UK tariff will be determined in the course of 2020.\n\nManaging quota order numbers\n\n\nDIT must take the lead in managing quota order numbers – this process has been introduced but not properly observed.\nIt needs to be a consultative process between DIT, HMRC and Defra to avoid errors and confusion, e.g. reusing existing quota order numbers\nHow quotas get set up is dependent on what they have been used for previously – we have inadvertently selected quota order numbers that were a cross section of closed and open quota order numbers, which have caused management challenges in previous migrations.\nAs of March 26th, the likelihood is that quota order numbers in the UK will be using ”08” as their first two digits to differentiate from the EU, with specific challenges around the dual Tariff in Northern Ireland being the primary cause. This remains to be agreed and properly analysed however.\n\nQuotas in reference documents\n\n\n\nAbove is a sample of the quota section of a reference document – it lists the quotas that are applicable to a given country or trading bloc (here is a mocked-up reference document for the ESA1 trading bloc).\nThe three highlighted data elements (with largely made up data for illustration purposes only), are data fields over and above what the Taric requires: these are not data that is needed by the HMRC systems, but is of benefit to creating reference documents.\nIn TAPv1, the reference document creation service had been created as a totally separate application (using Python / Django), whereas in round 2, it needs to be integrated.\nPlease see the training document on reference documents for more information\n\nFirst Come, First Served Quotas\n\nFirst Come, First Served quotas are far more prevalent than licensed quotas on the Tariff database.\nAs the name suggests this favours those traders that apply for the quota first\nThen, once the initial volume assigned to the quota has been fully depleted, the quota is deemed to be exhausted and is no longer available to draw down against. Once depleted, the trader’s import then falls back on the next best import duty, which may be a tariff preference, but it more likely just the MFN duty.\nThere is an important difference in the way in which FCFS are managed compared to licensed quotas:\nFCFS quotas pass through the HMRC systems that are of greatest interest to the DIT Tariff Application (CHIEF and CDS)\nLicensed quotas do not touch HMRC systems: instead they are handled essentially off-system via the RPA (see following slides)\nThe way in which the DIT application handles the different types of quotas is very different, as will be discussed.\n\nFirst Come First Served (FCFS) quotas: in the EU and with CHIEF\nThis diagram shows the data flows of traders making declarations on CHIEF against the EU’s quota allocation system for first come, first served quotas. At the time of writing (March 2020), 100% of the UK’s FCFS quota-related trade goes via this route (i.e. no involvement from CDS).\n\nFirst Come First Served (FCFS) quotas: in the EU still and with CDS\nThe migration of CHIEF to CDS had been planned some time before the referendum, as CHIEF is legacy software that, despite being highly reliable, is difficult to maintain and extend to cater for new requirements (such as full adherence to the UCC -  Union Customs Code). This diagram is an extension of the previous diagram while CHIEF is excluded from this diagram (to save complexity), it will still be in place for some time anyway – and thanks to the NI Protocol, probably for another 2 years at least. In reality, this planned architecture will not be available to GB traders for the foreseeable future, thanks to the required pivot to support NI.\n\nNI Protocol has changed the approach to CDS migration and this impacts quotas\nThe NI Protocol requires (over-simplified):\n\n\nall goods imported into Northern Ireland to be subject to EU regulatory controls in full\nall goods considered to be at risk of entering the EU via the NI / ROI boundary to be subject to EU import duties\nwhile those goods that are not at risk are subject to GB duties\n\nThis requires 2 tariffs to be present to work out the applicable duties based on the circumstances of the individual trade. This is too complex to do in CHIEF and a huge overhead to do in two systems concurrently anyway.\nTherefore CDS is now designated solely for NI traders (plus the 10 traders that have already been migrated), whereas all other (GB) traders will remain on CHIEF until a future date (to be specified).\nThe impact on quotas is that, by extension, imports to NI of at risk goods may still claim on EU quotas, and these requests will continue to need to be allocated via the EU Quota 2 system while UK quotas will be allocated by the new CDS Quota Allocation Module (QAM). There is a strong possibility for confusion for traders if the UK continues to share the same quota order numbers as the EU.\nArchitecture to support NI post Transition Period\nKey points to note in this diagram – CDS will have two tariff modules, one served by the EU to support NI regulatory controls and at risk duties, the other to support GB trade and NI not at risk trade. In theory (to be negotiated and unlikely to be deliverable by Jan 21), NI at risk goods will be able to take advantage of EU quotas, and therefore be allocated via Quota 2, not QAM. CHIEF GB declarations will send quota requests to QAM for allocation.\n\nThe Taric and FCFS quotas\nThe data objects that are utilised for FCFS are vastly more numerous than those used for licensed quotas\nLicensed quotas essentially use just measures not any of the other quota related tables. That is because all the other tables are set up uniquely to manage the set up and decrementing of quota balances.\n\nThe timespans of a FCFS quota\n\n\nThere are no limits on the periods that quotas can span, but there are commonalities, which these pages aim to share.\nThere are no quotas that are essentially one-offs – a quota is a permanent instrument to balance trade, not a one-time hit. The only slight deviation from this concerns the quotas that have been put in place to provide checks and balances on the import of steel goods (Steel safeguards), which evolve annually: this is just because the instrument is immature, not because it is a one-off.\nThe following types of quota periodicity can be found in the tariff:\n\n\nAnnual full year quota running from Jan 1st to December 31st and repeating every year\nAnnual full year quota running from another start date (e.g. July 1st to June 30th) and repeating every year\nPart year quota running from any date to any other date (e.g. Feb 14th to May 31st) and repeating between the same dates every year\nQuarterly quota running from Jan 1st to December 31st and repeating on that pattern every year\nQuarterly quota running from another start date but lasting a full 12 months and repeating on that pattern every year\nPart year quota split into monthly sections and repeating every year\n\nThese periods are enshrined in the legislation that engenders them – there is no deviation on the start and end dates of the periods (though watch out for leap years)\n\nTimespans in graphical format\n\nImpact of European growing seasons\n\nThere are more factors at play in determining quota volumes and periods than growing seasons (or marketing periods as they are called), but time of year is important for the EU, especially for Mediterranean countries.\nIn time, seasonality may be of less importance to the UK, as our climate does not (yet) suit the industrial levels of production seen in Southern Europe.\nQuota staging\n\n\nThe ultimate goal of a trade agreement is often to get to a place where there is a 0% import duty on goods being imported\nBut, if that goal were to be reached immediately, the toxic shock to domestic producers would be potentially crippling, as  internal markets are swept away in one fell swoop by cheap and abundant imports.\nTherefore the idea of staging has been adopted to allow domestic businesses to adjust to the new reality over time.\nStaging periods equate to the period over which a trade agreement reaches it ultimate goal:\n\n\nfor tariff preferences, this is usually finite. For example, an agreement may include the goal to reduce an import duty from 10% (the pre-agreement MFN) to 0% over 4 years, reducing by 2.5% per year. After 4 years, the duty remains at 0% for as long as the agreement remains in place\nfor staging in quotas, there is no finite end goal, just an increase in the volume of goods made available to the quota. For example at the start of a trade agreement, a quota may permit the import of 100,000 KGM of goods at a reduced rate. The agreement states that an additional 10,000 KGM are permitted per year. I have not seen a ceiling placed on this (e.g. an extra 10,000 KGM a year until it reached 200,000 KGM), but that does not mean it does not happen. The relaxation always takes place against the quota volume, not against the in-quota duties.\n\nStaging often appears in quotas created as part of a Trade Agreement, but never in WTO quotas or ATQs\n\nSafeguard quotas\n\n\nSince 2018, the EU has imposed quotas as part of its Steel Safeguards programme. Since 2017, USA has imposed swingeing import duties on steel and related goods coming into the country in order to protect its own industry from collapse\nThis led to a huge increase in the quantities of such goods coming into the European Union, as manufacturers (usually in the Far East), who previously had easy pickings in USA, now had to seek alternative markets.\nThe knock-on impact was felt in EU domestic steel suppliers, hence the imposition of steel safeguards by the EU.\nSafeguards had been extremely rare in the EU until 2018 and the use of quotas to support them had never been seen. Now they are part of the EU’s defence armoury and will be adopted largely like-for-like by the UK after the end of the implementation period.\nThe safeguard works like this:\n\n\na punitive duty of 25% import duty (type 696 – Additional duties (safeguard)) is applied to multiple steel products grouped in 28 categories. The duty is applied to c. 100 countries\nthen individual quotas are overlaid to remove the duties for certain countries up to a given volume – different quotas are set up for each of the 28 groups (with many country exclusions), some of the quotas being annual and some of the quotas being quarterly\n\nThis function is documented in detail elsewhere – warning: it is hugely complex and warrants very detailed attention.\nKnowing about the concepts behind quotas before digging into the safeguards will prepare you for the complexity.\n\nIntroductory periods\n\n\nThere are very many cases where an annual cadence is set up for a quota with an introductory period at the start that allows the quota to, for example, coincide with the Day One live implementation of a trade agreement, but to still allow the cadence to follow a marketing period.\nThis ‘introductory period’ will be critical also in the migration of quotas from the EU to the UK – if the implementation period ends on December 31st 2020, then there will be many quotas which will naturally start in the UK tariff on 1st January 2021, \n\n\nThis is the mode (annual quotas that run for a calendar year).\nBut, any quota that does not commence on Jan 1st for its annual cadence will potentially require an introductory period\nfor example, an annual quota that starts on July 1st will require a 6-month introductory period\nthe steel safeguard quotas that typically run in quarters from July 1st to June 30th will require two introductory periods of three months each\nbut a quotas which runs from Valentine’s day to the end of June will not\n\n\nIn-depth view of data tablesQuota data structures and fields\nThe next slides go through the structure of quotas as per the Taric, starting with the overarching quota object, the quota order number table.\n\nKey data fields - Quota order number table\n\n        \n          \n\nField\n\nNotes\n\n\nquota_order_number_sid\n\n•A unique sequential numeric   (internal) identifier for the quota.   •There may be more than one   instance of a quota order number ID in the quota order number table, with   different IDs\n\n\nquota_order_number_id\n\n•6-digit numerical field, e.g.   ‘091234’. In all current cases, the quota order number begins with the 2   digits ‘09’.   •If the first three digits are   ‘094’, then the quota must be a licensed quota: HMRC do not want to receive   data in the quota tables for such quotas.   •Depending on the needs of the   Northern Ireland Protocol, we may want to change away from using 09 as the   opening 2 digits, in order to clearly differentiate UK and EU quota order   numbers.   •Quota order numbers are not a   unique key: it it possible, and is frequently the case that an order number   is set up for a given period of time, then terminated, and restarted again at   a later date, either to reuse the order number for other purposes or because   the policy returns after an intermission.   •Additionally, quota order numbers   are terminated then restarted when the origins or origin exclusions change   •When a quota order number is used   on multiple occasions, a new record with a unique quota_order_number_sid   is created.\n\n\nValidity   start date\n\nThe   date on which a quota is first set up for use. A quota will then have   multiple periods either in-year or across multiple years, potentially with   introductory custom periods before the regular cadence commences\n\n\nValidity   end date\n\nThe   date on which the quota order number record terminates – this should, in   nearly every circumstance, be left blank – see pages on origins and origin   exclusions below for the exceptions\n\n        \n      \n\nThe quota order number table’s quota order number ID is linked to the measures table via the measures table’s ordernumber field (one of many examples where common field names do not match in Taric).\nThere are links also to the definition and origin tables (see below)\n\nThe quota definition table\n\n\nThe quota definition table is the table which defines the cadence of the quota and the volume of the goods that can be imported at reduced rates during each period.\nThe definition table does not contain any information about:\n\n\nthe commodity codes that are impacted\nthe geographical areas from which goods can be imported\nthe in quota duties that apply\n\nThere are a lot of tables that impact quotas, but the four below do the bulk of the work – the division of labour is noted\nYou may also hear quota definition referred to as quota account by HMRC.”\n\n\nThe quota definition in pictures\n\n\nThis graphic shows the relationship between quota order numbers and quota definitions (quotas are invented)\nImagine a world where a new regime starts, brand new on Jan 1st – it is virgin territory with nothing preceding it: this is not the case with the UK’s exit from the EU, where we will be continuing as much as we can.\nWe want all quotas to start asap (unless set to specific marketing periods)\n\n\nKey data fields - Quota definition table\n\n        \n          \n\nField\n\nNotes\n\n\nquota_definition_sid\n\n•A unique sequential numeric   (internal) identifier for the quota definition.   •There may be more than one   instance of a quota order number ID in the quota order number table, with   different IDs\n\n\nquota_order_number_id\n\n•Foreign key linking to the quota   order numbers table\n\n\nvalidity_start_date\n\n•The start date of the definition   period – this, along with the end date (below) is the critical date in   defining the active period of the quota definitions, against which the trader   can draw down.   •The quota definition periods   should run alongside the equivalent measures, however:   •The measures and definition   periods are obviously separate tables and provision must be made by the   application programmer to ensure that the measures and the quota definition   periods run concurrently to the same start dates and end dates   •The quota will not operate   without the measure or the definition period\n\n\nvalidity_end_date\n\n•End date of the period – see   above\n\n\nquota_order_number_sid\n\n•Foreign key to the SID of the   quota order number\n\n\nvolume\n\n•The current volume of the quota   definition – when DIT first set the volume, it should be set to the initial   volume.   •Once the quota is ‘handed over’   to HMRC and the start date has passed, DIT then has no ability to impact the   volume of the quota definition. If we try to send over an update to the   definition where the quota volume changes, the change will be rejected.    •We can only change the end date   and the description once the definition has started (formally), however this   is in name only, as there is no way of matching all the fields in the DIT XML   with the HMRC current data set and we cannot send over partial XML: once the   start date has passed, we can no longer influence the volume.\n\n\ninitial_volume\n\n•The initial volume of the quota –   this remains constant in the HMRC systems post-initiation of the definition   period.   •We set the volume and initial   volume to the same figure   •Only the volume decrements in   HMRC systems   •Volume is dependent of the units   (see next slide)\n\n\nmeasurement_unit_code\n\n•The primary unit in which the   quota volume is measured   •Usually this will be kilogrammes,   sometimes it is litres, of number of items   •In migrating from the EU data set   into the UK data set, watch out for sloppiness and inconsistency in the   legislation compared to the implementation – this can affect the units in   which quotas are declared.   •In terms of operationalising a   quota, it is preferable to use a smaller unit rather than a large one – i.e.   you will see most quotas are defined against a unit of KGM rather than TNE   (tonne), as this allows traders to bring in smaller amounts and account for   them accurately.   •The legislation will often refer   to tonnes – you will need to multiply the volumes by 1,000 in that case\n\n\nmeasurement_unit_     qualifier_code\n\n•If the measurement unit needs   further definition, then the measurement unit qualifier code can be used to   provide that additional definition: it is used sparingly. See the document on   measure components for more info, as the concept for quota definitions is the   same,\n\n\nmaximum_precision\n\n•This is invariably set to 3 these   days. It determines the number of decimal places that a trader can enter into   their declaration form requesting an allocation (allows for grams of goods to   be imported against a quota measured in kilos)\n\n\ncritical_state\n\n•The critical state determines if   a trader needs to pay securities (essentially a deposit) when utilising the   quota.   •There are two states Yes or No.   If the state is set to Yes, then securities are required; if set to No, then   securities are not required.   •DIT do not need to care about the   mechanism for collecting securities, as this falls into the HMRC domain   •It it is a DIT responsibility to   set criticality however for all definitions: the unwritten rules around   criticality are described in a few slides time\n\n\ncritical_threshold\n\n•The criticality threshold   determines the point at which a quota definition / account slips into being   critical. Almost without exception on the entire tariff an without exception   in the last 5 years, the criticality threshold is set to 90.   •This means that once 90% of the   quota volume has been used up, the quota will be automatically changed to   ‘Critical’   •See below for more information on   quota definition states and criticality threshold.\n\n\nmonetary_unit_code\n\n•In the EU tariff, there are a few   quotas that are measured according to the total value   of the goods coming into the bloc rather than weight / volume etc.   •See   quotas 090103, 090101, 090106, 090104, 092501, 092501, 090825, 090786   •The   first 6 of these are silk or fine materials: presumably they are so gossamer   thin that weight is irrelevant and only monetary value is of interest   •The   others are house plants etc from Norway, which is a quota that we do not   intend to pursue in the UK (at the last count)   •It   is an oddity of Taric that, even though there are values in the measurement   unit table that look like they could be used for this purpose, they are not   used in this way (EURO - Euro – for statistic purposes is a valid measurement   unit)   •Even though the UK tariff shows   no inclination of adopting any of these 8 quotas, we will still need to   maintain this functionality going forward: what if we do introduce quotas on   silk products in the future? That may be unlikely, as we have no silk industry   in the UK of course (it is big in Italy).\n\n\ndescription\n\n•This field has little overt value   and no way of exposing it to the trading public, however it is of value to   populate the field to provide an ‘at a glance’ view of the nature of the   definition.   •It is a weakness of the Taric   data structure that there is no way of defining a ‘description’ of the quota   as a whole.   •TAP 1’s preference was to create   a description against the quota order number itself and then to inherit that   down to the definitions that belong to the quota, appending specifics of the   definition to the definition’s description (such as the dates), though this   could be construed as superfluous.\n\n        \n      Criticality\n\n\nAs described above, the critical state determines if a trader needs to pay securities when utilising the quota.\nThe purpose of the requirement to collect securities is to\n\n\na) attempt to provide some sort of level playing field for traders as a quota reaches exhaustion\nb) try to reduce returns towards the end of a definition’s active life span – managing returns is a hassle and if a trader has paid a security, the are less likely to be blasé with unused quota volume.\n\nIt is up to DIT to set the critical state of a quota definition, as we set all the properties of a quota definition period before it has begun, including critical state.\nThe rules of thumb are:\na new quota should be set to critical for three years so that there is an opportunity to study trade flows to determine if the volumes are correct\nsetting critical to ‘Y’ for this period ensures that the trade flow is more reflective of actual trade, dispensing with traders that declare a need for quota volume, but then do not use it.\nBUT at the same time, for HMRC to take securities is a major overhead and they prefer not to in all cases.\nSo, during the 3 non-Brexits to date, the critical state for all quota definition periods has been set to N initially:\n\n\nin order to reduce workload for HMRC\nbecause most trade flows were fairly well known through UK;s membership of the EU\nwe were not introducing many genuinely new quotas (though the maxim was applied to all)\n\nHMRC will need to be consulted in the lead-up to the implementation period on what they want to do with criticality: it is their domain, but our responsibility to set the initial state. This will be especially vital if we kick off any brand new trade deals with new overseas trading partners on Day One, which is remotely possible.\n\nManaging geography\n\nA FCFS quota only works when the full set of quota tables and measure tables are all set up and synchronised. It’s important to understand a few points around the geography of these two entities in order to create the right data.\n* geography has to be set correctly against both the measure and the quota order number\n* while the measures table has a 1-2-1 relationship with geographical areas, the quota order number table can relate to multiple origins via the many-to-many linking table “quota order number origins”.\n*Geographical areas – concepts *\nAssigning quotas to countries\n\n\nA quota can be assigned either to an individual country or to a group of countries\nAs described on the previous page, it may also be assigned to multiple (single) countries as well; theoretically, there is no reason why the quota cannot be assigned to multiple country groups simultaneously, though this has never happened.\nThere are currently (in the EU tariff) several quotas that are assigned to multiple (single) countries, but these will not carry over into the UK tariff (needs to be re-checked).\n\n\nFor example, quota order number 091530 is assigned to import of wines from the Western Balkan states of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia.\nWhile the UK will aim to engineer trade agreements with all 6 of these prior to the end of the implementation period, the quotas will be split into individual quotas per country.\n\nThe aim must be to still permit assignment of quotas to multiple countries however, as the model permits it.\nFor each assignment of geographical area to quota order number, the following is required:\n\n\na record in the measures table, linking geographical_area_id and ordernumber.\na record in the quota_order_number_origins table, linking geographical_area_id and quota_order_number_id.\n\n\nExcluding countries from quotas\n\n\nWhen a quota is assigned to a country group, it is possible and very common to exclude countries from that group, such that the quota does not apply to that country. Examples of this are:\n\n\nquotas that apply on food and drink that apply to Central America, but from which Panama is excluded\nalmost all of the steel safeguard quotas feature multiple exclusions.\n\nObviously, the excluded country may be a member of the country group that’s assigned to the quota.\nFor each exclusion of a country from a quota associated to a country group, the following is required:\n\n\na record in the quota order number origin exclusions table, linking the origin and the excluded geographical area.\na record in the measure_excluded_geographical_areas table, linking the origin and the excluded geographical area.\n\n\nKey data fields - Quota order number origins \u0026 exclusions table\n\n        \n          \n\nField\n\nNotes\n\n\nquota_order_number_origin_sid\n\n•A unique sequential numeric   (internal) identifier for the quota origin.   •There may be more than one origin   assigned to a quota order number ID\n\n\nquota_order_number_sid\n\n•Foreign key to the SID of the   order number to which the origin links\n\n\ngeographical_area_id\n\n•ID (e.g. NO for Norway) to which   the origin applies\n\n\nvalidity_start_date\n\n•Date from which the origin   applies to the quota order number\n\n\nvalidity_end_date\n\n•Date to which the origin applies   to the quota order number\n\n\ngeographical_area_sid\n\n•Foreign key to the SID of the   geographical area to which the origin links\n\n        \n      \n        \n          \n\nField\n\nNotes\n\n\nquota_order_number_origin_sid\n\n•Foreign key to the SID of the   origin from which the country is to be excluded\n\n\nexcluded_geographical_area_sid\n\n•Foreign key to the SID of the   excluded geographical area\n\n        \n      Any entries made in these two quota origin-related tables must also be matched by entries in the measures and measure_excluded_geographical_areas tables.\nStrategies for managing origins and exclusions\n\n\nQuota order number origins have start dates and end dates\nQuota order number origins do not have start dates and end dates\nIf you want to alter the quota order number origin exclusions for a quota, and you don’t want it to happen immediately, you cannot just add the exclusion to the origin: it will take effect immediately, which is almost certainly not the requirement.\nAs case in point is the steel safeguards:\n\n\neach year to date, the origin exclusions have been tweaked as the EU has discovered more about world trade flows and the impact of both the US and EU safeguards on that flow\nthe EU has not been able to just remove and add exclusions\n\nThere are two options:\n\n\neither end the origin and start another origin\nor end the quota order number and start another quota order number with a new origin\n\nThe EU chooses the latter option: terminating the quota order number and replacing with another one starting the next day with a new origin.\n\n\nin TAP1, we followed this route: the alternative route may also be followed.\n\n\nQuota exception periods and events\n\n\n\nLinked to the definition tables are 8 additional tables:\n\n\n2 of these, the period tables are useful – these are discussed in the relevant documents (blocking and suspending quotas)\nThe other 6 are of no interest to DIT in terms of managing the UK tariff – these are reflections of the operational state of EU quotas. As DIT has no interest in the operationalisation of the quotas, we will not need to worry about them.\n\nIf there is a requirement to continue to support the EU tariff, then all data tables should be loaded, including the events tables.\nThe tables are extremely simple nonetheless, should they be required.\nThere is an additional entity in the XSD, the quota.closed.and.transferred.event which is historical\n\nHMRC and DIT responsibilities re: quotas\n\nLicensed quotasQuota data structures and fields\nNone of the quota tables outside of the blue box below are relevant to licensed quotas\n\nLicensed quotas – which products and how many?\n\n\nThe ways to apply for the use of a licensed quota are laid out in the regulations that support them and they may differ according to the product that is concerned.\nLicensed quotas are never used for anything other than agricultural products\n\n\n        \n          \n\nChapter\n\nMeasure count\n\n\nChapter   01 - LIVE ANIMALS\n\n50\n\n\nChapter   02 - MEAT AND EDIBLE MEAT OFFAL\n\n1011\n\n\nChapter   04 - DAIRY PRODUCE; BIRDS’ EGGS; NATURAL HONEY; EDIBLE PRODUCTS OF ANIMAL   ORIGIN, NOT ELSEWHERE SPECIFIED OR INCLUDED\n\n260\n\n\nChapter   07 - EDIBLE VEGETABLES AND CERTAIN ROOTS AND TUBERS\n\n14\n\n\nChapter   10 - CEREALS\n\n116\n\n\nChapter   11 - PRODUCTS OF THE MILLING INDUSTRY; MALT; STARCHES; INULIN; WHEAT GLUTEN\n\n13\n\n\nChapter   15 - ANIMAL OR VEGETABLE FATS AND OILS AND THEIR CLEAVAGE PRODUCTS; PREPARED   EDIBLE FATS; ANIMAL OR VEGETABLE WAXES\n\n1\n\n\nChapter   16 - PREPARATIONS OF MEAT, OF FISH OR OF CRUSTACEANS, MOLLUSCS OR OTHER   AQUATIC INVERTEBRATES\n\n73\n\n\nChapter   17 - SUGARS AND SUGAR CONFECTIONERY\n\n62\n\n\nChapter   20 - PREPARATIONS OF VEGETABLES, FRUIT, NUTS OR OTHER PARTS OF PLANTS\n\n8\n\n\nChapter   35 - ALBUMINOIDAL SUBSTANCES; MODIFIED STARCHES; GLUES; ENZYMES\n\n13\n\n\nGrand Total\n\n1621\n\n        \n      Licensed quota process – by example (garlic)\n\n\nPossible garlic traders are grouped into two groups:\n\n\nnew importers – 30% of quota licenses are available for new importers\ntraditional importers – 70% of quota licenses are available for traditional importers (those who can prove they have imported garlic frequently over the last x years)\n\nAll declarants must register with the RPA (Rural Payments Agency)\nApplications must be submitted using an import licence application form (AGRIM), downloadable from gov.uk\nQuota applications may be made at certain specific periods in the year (for garlic, applications must be received during the first seven calendar days of April, July, October and January), and must be accompanied by securities and proof of trade\nLicenses are issued within a given date window, and may be used then in a short fixedperiod only from the point of issue\nMost importantly for us, all we need to set up is the relationship between thecommodity, the measure type, the time period, the in-quota duty rate and the origin– there is no concept of number of licenses / import volumes to be concernedabout in DIT.\n\nTAP 1 – Approach to licensed quotas\n\n\nThe approach to building quotas in the first version of the Tariff Application was to not use any of the tables outside of the blue marquee on the previous screen for building licensed quotas.\nThe reason for this was to avoid any data for licensed quotas being sent to the HMRC systems that would cause compatibility issues on arrival. Therefore, that project only used the measures table for licensed quotas\nIt may be considered as useful to use at least the quota_order_number table to capture quota order numbers in the 2nd iteration if this helps certain functions in the new application, such as the quota search function, then it may be advisable to utilise this table\nThe approach needs to be decided by the new team\nThe database that you will receive on arrival will contain no reference to licensed quotas at all in any tables other than the measures table.\n\nJersey, Guernsey and quotas\n\nQuota user needs\n        \n          \n\nAs a …\n\nI want to…\n\nSo that …\n\nNotes\n\n\nTariff   Manager\n\nsearch   through a list of existing quotas\n\nI   can find quotas to export, edit, duplicate, terminate or otherwise operate on   in order to accurately maintain the UK trade policy\n\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\n\ncreate   a new (single) quota\n\nI   can keep both the Tariff Application and the downstream border systems up to   date with the latest trade position.\n\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\n\nedit   the properties of an existing quota    -description   -start   date   -end   date   -category   etc.\n\nI   can update the changes imposed and also be sent to the relevant external   systems.\n\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\n\nterminate   an existing measure, either individually or in bulk\n\nthe   measure will not be imposed on the relevant external systems.\n\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\n\ncreate,   edit and terminate origins for a quota\n\nthe   quota can be applied to imports from a given country or country group\n\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\n\ncreate,   edit and terminate definitions for a quota\n\na   given initial volume can be set for a quota and passed to the border systems   to operationalise\n\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\n\ncreate,   edit and terminate suspension periods for a quota\n\nI   can prevent a quota from being usable for a given period\n\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\n\ncreate,   edit and terminate blocking periods for a quota\n\nI   can block CDS from processing declaration requests that call on a given quota   for a defined period\n\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\n\nview   the measures associated with a given quota\n\nI   can validate that the data that is available on the border systems is correct\n\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\n\nview   the commodities associated with a given quota\n\nI   can validate that the commodities associated with a quota are correct, and to   export that data\n\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\n\ncreate,   edit and terminate associations for a quota of type NM\n\nI   can limit the usage of a quota of given sub-categories of commodities   assigned to a quota, or limit the usage of a quota to a given a country /   origin\n\nMust   Have\n\n\nTariff   Manager\n\ncreate,   edit and terminate associations for a quota of type EQ\n\nI   can apply differential coefficients to the volumes of goods being brought in   on a   quota\n\nMust   Have\n\n        \n      Quota business rules\n        \n          \n\n#\n\nDescription\n\nNotes\n\n\nON1\n\nQuota order number id + start date must be unique\n\nRequired – high priority   It is very possible to have more than one quota order number   with the same ID, and this is used for quotas that become obsolete and then   the quota order number is reused.

similarly a single commodity code can have an association with multiple additional codes, again through measures applied to a given combination of commodity and additional code.\n\nWhat are additional codes used for?\n\nAdditional codes are now used to manage:\n\n\nMeursing codes – for sugar, flour and milk duties associated with complex agricultural products\nAnti-dumping \u0026 anti-subsidy duties – to identify the specific company to which a punitive measure is attached\nPharma products – to identify that the end use of an imported good is for pharmaceutical purposes, and therefore attracts a reduced duty\nDifferentiating product states / uses / origins (e.g. waste chemicals, underwear [!])\nRoute of ingress – to identify the route goods (wheat \u0026 other cereals) take into EU and to apply different tariff or regulatory treatment\nWorks of art – to identify items stolen from Syria and Iraq as a result of wartime activity\n\nEach of the above uses are discussed in detail on the following slides.\nAdditional codes are made up of 4 digits, which are split into two parts:\n\n\nStructure of additional codes and additional code types\n\nMuch like certificates and footnotes, additional codes are made up of a type and then a specific ID, which, when concatenated, form the unique ID of the additional code. .\nFor example, the additional code C233 is constructed of a type © and a specific footnote ID (233) – the entire additional code is known as C233.\nThe numeric IDs, running from 001 to 999 can be reused across multiple additional code type IDs.\nWhile the schema allows for us to use alphanumeric digits for additional codes, not just numeric, these are almost never used and never by the EU – there are 7 national additional codes that are used by HMRC for VAT and excise.\nThe use of the alphanumeric codes may be of great importance to the Northern Ireland protocol, subject to the way in which the solution progresses.\nAdditional code type IDs are always single alphabetical characters (those set by the EU) or single numeric characters (set as national additional code by the UK).\n\n\nOverview of existing additional code types\n        \n          \nID\nDescription\nAC count\n\n2\nTariff   preference\n5\n\n3\nProhibition/Restriction/Surveillance\n118\n\n4\nRestrictions\n51\n\n7\nAgricultural   Tables (Meursing)\n504   ***\n\n8\nAnti-dumping/countervailing\n188\n\nA\nAnti-dumping/countervailing\n265\n\nB\nAnti-dumping/countervailing\n920\n\nC\nAnti-dumping/countervailing\n483\n\nV\nVAT\n3\n\nX\nEXCISE\n66\n\n        \n      ***Meursing additional codes are special cases and stored in a different database table from the other additional codes\n\n\nThe table above lists all of the additional code types which are currently in use, supporting active additional codes.\nThe table below shows all of the additional code types on the database (in use or not)\nAdditional code types cannot be reused if they are not terminated – we will need to create new additional code types for the UK to cater for UK-specific future anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases.\nSee section on Trade Remedies later in this document.\n\n\n        \n          \nID\nDescription\n\n2\nTariff   preference\n\n3\nProhibition/Restriction/Surveillance\n\n4\nRestrictions\n\n6\nAgricultural   Tables (non-Meursing)\n\n7\nAgricultural   Tables (Meursing)\n\n8\nAnti-dumping/countervailing\n\n9\nExport   Refunds\n\nA\nAnti-dumping/countervailing\n\nB\nAnti-dumping/countervailing\n\nC\nAnti-dumping/countervailing\n\nD\nDual   Use\n\nF\nReference   prices fishery products\n\nP\nRefund   for basic products\n\nV\nVAT\n\nX\nEXCISE\n\n        \n      Pivot table on usage of additional codes vs measure types\n\nType 2 - Preference codesThere are only two remaining reasons in the EU tariff for using preference type additional codes – when the UK takes over ownership, there will be just one.\n\n        \n          \nCode(s)\nDescription \u0026 notes\n\n2   500     2   501\nThese   two codes are used to differentiate between the duties applicable to imported   goods which may or may not be subject to reduced duties for pharmaceutical   products. In the EU, this is legislated for in Annex I of the “Combined   Nomenclature”, Part Three, Section II (pharmaceutical products).          In   the UK these additional codes will persist, though the specific legislative   mechanism for persisting them remains to be decided.\n\n2   550     2   551     2   552     2   553\nThese   codes are used in the EU to apply differential duties to goods (wheat,   sorghum and other cereal goods) dependent upon their route of ingress into   the European Union.          These   will not be persisted into the UK tariff: a) because we are not carrying   forward the operationalising of the agricultural policy to apply variable   duties on cereals (though we are retaining the right to revert if required)   and b) the routes are not relevant to a newly-independent UK.\n\n        \n      Type 3 – P \u0026 R codesThese codes are on the surface vey similar to those used under additional code type 4 – it is not clear why one might be used in opposition to the other.\n\n        \n          \nCode(s)\nDescription \u0026 notes\n\n3   200     3   202     3   203     3   204     3   205     3   206     3   207     3   208     3   249\nThese   additional codes are used to differentiate between specific states of certain   chemical compounds: if the product is in a certain state, then a different   export code restriction applies, as explained in the footnote:          “The   surveillance does not apply to mixtures and natural products which contain   scheduled substances and which are compounded in such a way that the   scheduled substances cannot be easily used or extracted by readily applicable   or economically viable means, to medicinal products as defined in point 2 of   Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the   Council and to veterinary medicinal products as defined in point 2 of Article   1 of Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.”          The   purpose of the these codes is to provide the ability to slice multiple   commodities according to their intrinsic properties.\n\n3   601     3   602     3   603\nI   kid you not – this group of additional codes is to apply additional   restrictions to the import of pants and bras from North Korea. The additional   code provides an additional slide over the top of the existing commodities   without creating multiple new comm codes.\n\n        \n      Type 4 – Restriction codesThink of this type of additional codes as a means of differentiating between:\npotential multiple uses of goods, where splitting all the codes would be inadvisable, complex, confusing, or impossible\na way of differentiating origin / specifics, even if via several intermediary steps\n\n        \n          \nCode(s)\nDescription \u0026 notes\n\n4   008 – 4 099\nThese   codes have been instituted as a means of instituting temporary controls   (restrictions) on goods that have been plundered following the chaos in Iraq   and Syria, for example after the destruction of Palmyra. Rather than   permanently splitting existing commodity codes, typically (but not   exclusively) in chapters 97 and 98 (works of art) etc., the European   Commission has created additional codes to determine origin of goods, even if   they have passed through multiple trades prior to the entry into the EU. For   this reason, many of the controls apply not just to Iraq and Syria, but also   to Erga Omnes / All third countries (1011, 1008 respectively).          Chapters   97 and 98 are very shallow – in some cases, the definitions only go down to   HS4 without any further cleaving of codes – the EU cannot introduce codes at   6 digits, even if that was desirable, so the choice would have been: create a   very few additional codes to designate source OR create a large number of   10-digit codes to represent permanent splits.\n\n4   115 to 4 118\nUsed   to apply controls to waste materials and ozone-depleting substances\n\n4   200 to 4 212\nUsed   to differentiate the skins and furs of wild cats (e.g. lynxes) as well as   other mammals sometimes (illegally) used for their fur (e.g. otters \u0026   pine martens)\n\n        \n      Type 7 - Meursing codes\n\nIntroduced in 1988 by the European Commission. Traders hate them, but we have to keep Meursing classifications or change our WTO commitments.\nThey apply to bakery and confectionery products, etc. classed as “composite agrigoods”. Meursing allows extra set of import duties to be charged depending on how much of 4 agricultural ingredients are used to make the product: milk fat, milk proteins, starch or glucose, or various forms of sugar.\nThe result used to be tens of thousands of categories of composite agrigoods for the purposes of charging import duties. To find the specific ‘recipe’ and the duties applicable, you look it up in the Meursing table (right).\nExecuted in the tariff as a combination of primary measures, such as tariff preferences, with complex duty expression combinations, which are then expanded when the trader select the ‘additional code’ for the specific ‘recipe’ of their product.\nThe best description of Meursing codes and their use is drawn up by Trade expert Peter Unghpakorn on his trade beta blog: https://tradebetablog.wordpress.com/2016/08/18/eu-tariff-biscuit-annex1/\n\n\n\nFuture of Meursing codes\n\nThe Meursing code is a staple of EU agrifood trade.\nThe UK policy however is to abandon Meursing codes as an agricultural policy, due to the fact that it is universally disliked by trade and policy (Defra) alike – the tax-raising reasons for it having come into existence in the first place are not UK policy.\nHowever, as with much of the Northern Ireland protocol, there are additional implications for UK government and Northern Ireland traders with NI remaining in a special relationship with the EU’s Customs Union.\nInitial thoughts are that the impact of the NI protocol will not be felt for GB traders, but NI traders will continue to need to apply Meursing codes to imports of specific types if the good is considered to be at risk of being further transported to the EU.\nAt the very least, this requires DIT policy and DDaT to retain some knowledge of the Meursing challenge, even if the majority of the UK will not be subject to the controls\n\nApplication of a Meursing code in detail – Waffles and wafers\n\nLet’s take “waffles and wafers - with a water content exceeding 10% by weight”, commodity code 1905320500.\n\nThe third country duty reads as follows:9.00% + EA MAX 20.7% + ADFM\nThis is a complex compound duty involving both a ceiling and a pair of Meursing-related placeholders. These placeholders come in three forms, which, in the EU are labelled:\nEA – Agricultural component\nADFM – Additional duty on flour\nADSZ – Additional duty on sugar (not shown here, but the principle applies)\nThe labels are based on French and German abbreviations (élément agricole, farine / mehl; sucre / Zucker)\nThe next section shows the breakdown – and what traders have to do\n\n\nUnpicking complex agricultural duties\n\nThe waffle duty 9.00% + EA MAX 20.7% + ADFM is made up of 4 measure components – please review the training manual on measure components for a detailed view of these.\n\n\n        \n          \nDuty expression ID\nDuty amount\nCommentary\n\n01\n9.00\nAd valorem duty\n\n12\n-\nMeursing placeholder –   agricultural component\n\n17\n20.7\nCeiling ad valorem ( … up to a   maximum of …)\n\n27\n-\nMeursing placeholder – additional   duty on flour\n\n        \n      \n\nThe first thing to notice is that the Meursing placeholders have no duties assigned to them – it is not possible to assign duty amounts to these measure components; they operate as placeholders that are filled in only when traders declare the content of the various delicious ingredients.\nThe trader goes to (for example) the gov.uk URL below, enters the component %ages and then is eventually presented with a 4-digit code, such as 7364.\nDuties are then assigned specifically against the Meursing additional code 7364, totally independent of the hundreds of commodities that are subject to them – this is unique in the tariff database, where duties are usually against combinations of commodity codes and additional codes - not with Meursings.\n\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/additional-commodity-code\nImplications for Tariffs project\n\nAlthough it is theoretically possible that the UK will need to manage Meursing additional codes and their associated duties in the future, it is highly unlikely\nRecommendation would be that no interface functionality is constructed to allow for managing Meursing codes themselves, as it is hugely complex.\nTheoretically, if we wanted to just change the duties associated with the Meursing additional codes, this is possible: it is a matter of assigning duties direct to an additional code, rather than to a combination of commodity codes and additional codes.\n\nMeursing table and the reduction indicator\n\nThere is one Meursing table but multiple layers of tariffs assigned against it\nThe “reduction indicator” is assigned to the tariff measure on the commodity code and to the duty assigned to the additional code. The border system picks the indicator that matches to select the right duty.\nIn use with multiple preferential agreements that reference composite agrigoods.\nJapan goes to town on the usage of reduction indicators, forcing the EU to change its Taric schema to accommodate another three reduction tables.\nBy the end of the implementation period, be aware of two facts:\nwe will have done away with the concept of Meursing codes in the UK, therefore the reduction indicator will be irrelevant\nwe will not have a trade agreement with Japan\nBUT:\nwe will need to honour the NI protocol, meaning Meursings will apply to imports of at risk goods from RoW and GB to NI, meaning DIT and DDaT need to continue to be aware of their presence.\n\n\nType 8, A, B, C – Anti-subsidy / anti-dumping codesA Trade Remedy is explained elsewhere, but the important thing to note is that, for the two types of trade remedy that are by some distance the most abundant, Anti-dumping duties and Anti-subsidy duties, the punitive import duties are set against specific exporting companies that are deemed to have acted unlawfully, not against entire countries.\nEssentially, a company is proven to have been dumping1 its goods on an overseas market (e.g. the European Union or the United Kingdom), or to have been receiving unlawful state subsidy to undercut international competitors, and this activity is found to have been damaging businesses in those overseas nations. In such cases, the nation or bloc’s Trade Remedies body, such as our own Trade Remedies Authority, is entitled to investigate and impose punitive duties specifically against the companies that have been proven to have acted unlawfully.\nIn the case of Trade Remedies, the 4-digit additional code is set to represent the company from which the good is imported, or in some cases, a multitude of companies that have been found guilty of the same infraction.\n\n\nBy way of example:\nCode C316 refers to Bengang Steel Plates Co., Ltd (Benxi, Liaoning)\nCode C333 refers to all of:\n* Aeolus Tyre Co., Ltd;\n* Aeolus Tyre (Taiyuan) Co., Ltd;\n* Qingdao Yellow Sea Rubber Co., Ltd;\n* Pirelli Tyre Co., Ltd\nTo create a punitive trade remedy duty against a the import of “flat rolled steel” from “Bengang Steel Plates”, you assign a 552 measure against commodity code 7225990092 and additional code C316.\n\nWhen the European Commission first set up the Taric database to cater for all trade eventualities, they were somewhat guilty of short-sightedness when it came to Trade Remedies.\nThey set up the additional type code ‘8’ in 1972 to deal with all future companies implicated in Trade Remedy cases. To be fair, this lasted until 1999, when the 1,000 possible permutations within the ‘8 ‘ type code (000 to 999) were exhausted. They then moved on to using ‘A’. In 2013, they moved on to ‘B’ and in ‘2015’ to ‘C’. By 2019, type ‘C’ was already half used up, so the expectation would be that they will move on to another additional code type within the next 2 years.\n‘D’ is already used for dual use codes, albeit it is currently dormant.\nIn preparing for the multiple abortive stabs at EU Exit, the project team has (via scripts) created an additional set of additional code types (‘E’ and ‘F’) to cater for the inevitable expansion and deviation.\nAdditional codes, according to the Taric schema may be alphabetical, as well as numeric – alpha characters have never been used by the EU, but there is no reason why we could not use them in the future in the UK.\n\n\nAdditional codes used in Trade Remedies measures are essentially meaningless beyond Tariff – there is literally no reference against any international database of companies, nor any attempt to make the data set atomic and ‘cleansed’\nYou are likely to find multiple instances of the same company cropping up in the database on multiple occasions.\nBe careful about the shenanigans that companies get up to evade punitive duties – most often by setting up subsidiaries in overseas nations with similar names: these are not the same company, nor the same additional code, but they may have very similar company names.\n\nAdditional codes cannot be applied universallyThere is an additional many to many table within the tariff database that determines which additional code types can be used against which measure types. Currently there are 74 permutations of additional codes against measure types: there is little surprising about the alignment – e.g. you can only assign additional codes of type 8, A, B or C to measure types that are associated with Trade Remedies.\n\nAdditional codes, additional code types data entities\nScreen designs[LEAVING THIS SECTION OUT AS NOT YET DECIDED WHERE THIS SECTION SHOULD BE PLACED IN THE MANUAL -

Therefore this must be checked.     In actual fact, the rule is written incorrectly here.

Quota blocking periods are applicable only to First Come First Serve quotas.\nPlease read the discussion on blocking quotas before reading this - the introduction to quotas is useful and the concepts are very similar.\n\nWhy are quotas blocked?\n\nQuota blocks are placed on quotas for a limited period of time to prevent allocations from being taken.\nUnlike suspensions, which effectively invalidate a quota (as if it does not exist and is suspended in law), all a blocking period does is to prevent allocations from being made: it does not prevent declarations from being made against a quota: it just postpones any allocation decision.\nA quota blocking period usually coincides with the start of a definition period, though not always; for instance, a common blocking reason is to protect the re-opening of a quota after significant returns\nThis effect of a quota blocking period is to give HMRC an opportunity to assess the demand for a quota and potentially give an opportunity for them to make subjective decisions on allocations, e.g. to prevent a single large business from using up an entire allocation before smaller players have got their act together.\n277 of the 455 blocking periods created in 2019 coincided with the start of definition period.\nIn these cases, it is most likely that the block will last c. 2 or 3 weeks\n\n\nQuota blocking reasonsUnlike with suspensions, where the Tariff Manager can only enter descriptive text to describe a suspension period, blocking periods include a field which describe the reason for the blocking period.\n\n        \n          \n\nID\n\nReason\n\nCount\n\n\n1\n\nBlock   the allocations for a quota due to a late publication.\n\n1637\n\n\n2\n\nBlock   the allocations for a quota after its reopening due to a volume increase.\n\n82\n\n\n3\n\nBlock   the allocations for a quota after its reopening due to the reception of quota   return requests.\n\n1665\n\n\n4\n\nBlock   the allocations for a quota due to the modification of the validity period   after receiving quota return requests.\n\n7\n\n\n5\n\nBlock   the allocations for a quota on request of a MSA.\n\n3\n\n\n6\n\nBlock   the allocations for a quota due to an end-user decision.\n\n69\n\n\n7\n\nBlock   the allocations for a quota due to an exceptional condition.\n\n178\n\n\n8\n\nBlock   the allocations for a quota after its reopening due to a balance transfer.\n\n8\n\n        \n      Options 1 and 3 are the most common – option 1 actually seems more by design that just accidental late publication\nLogical model of a quota blocking period\n\nA quota starts on Jan 1st and runs throughout the year\nThe decision is taken to place a block on the quota for the first 15 days, to allow HMRC to make an assessment on potential usage of the quota, by taking allocation requests, but not actually allocating / decrementing the opening balance\nThis gives smaller traders and new entrants an opportunity to take advantage of the reduced rate\nSimplified quotas data model (as applies to blocking periods)\nQuota blocking data object in detailAs with suspension periods, the quota blocking object is not one of the more complex objects in the database: there are few fields, in fact there are only three that you need to actively define.\n\n\n        \n          \n\nField\n\nDescription\n\n\nquota_blocking_period_sid\n\nUnique   identifier, automatically generated by the application when a new suspension   period is created – you do not create this yourself\n\n\nquota_definition_sid\n\nThe   quota definition to which the suspension is to be attached – you do not need   to enter the ID of the definition: you select it from a list (as will be   demonstrated)\n\n\nblocking_start_date\n\nThe   start date of the suspension blocking period – i.e. 00:00 at the start of the   chosen day\n\n\nblocking_end_date\n\nThe   end date of the suspension blocking period – i.e. 00:00 at the end of the   chosen day\n\n\nblocking_periods_type\n\nOne   of the 8 options noted previously – largely options 1 or 3\n\n\ndescription\n\nAn   optional field, up to 500 characters in length, that helps to define the   blocking period and the reasons for it.\n\n        \n      \nA blocking period must fit within a definition periodThe critical point is that a quota blocking period is defined against a quota definition period: the blocking period MUST NOT straddle the boundary of the definition – in the rare occasion you need to straddle a boundary, create 2 blocking periods\n\nManaging blocking periods on TAP[Not yet sure if this will go in a different section so I have omitted this from this page for now -

The purpose of this is to ensure that there is a ‘legal base’ for all tariff and regulatory activity, without which the measures could not be traced back to the initial purpose for their existence.\nThe requirement for a regulation is built into the the schema for TARIC files and is a mandatory field for the measure table.\n\n\nG\n\n\n\nmeasure1\n\nMeasure\n\n\n\nconditions1\n\nConditions\n\n\n\nmeasure1--conditions1\n\n\n\n\nmeasure2\n\nMeasure\n\n\n\nconditions2\n\nConditions\n\n\n\nmeasure2--conditions2\n\n\n\n\nmeasure3\n\nMeasure\n\n\n\nconditions3\n\nConditions\n\n\n\nmeasure3--conditions3\n\n\n\n\nRegulation\n\nRegulation\n\n\n\nRegulation--measure1\n\n\n\n\nRegulation--measure2\n\n\n\n\nRegulation--measure3\n\n\n\n\ncomponents1\n\nComponents\n\n\n\nconditions1--components1\n\n\n\n\ncomponents2\n\nComponents\n\n\n\nconditions2--components2\n\n\n\n\ncomponents3\n\nComponents\n\n\n\nconditions3--components3\n\n\n\nEach regulation may have any number of measures associated with it and every measure is associated with just one measure-generating regulation. This terminology “measure-generating” is critical, as there is another regulation that is associated with measures’ terminations, which is called the “justification regulation”.\nRegulations in the EUThe EU has instituted an incredibly complicated data schema for regulations, which is perhaps suited to European law-making but much less so to the UK. In addition to this structure being inappropriate from a policy perspective, it is also technically über-complex.\nInstead of being able to link to a single regulations table to list all regulations, there are multiple tables, notably base_regulations and modification_regulations. This leads to extremely inefficient data calls, but is necessary to match the EU’s law making.\nBase regulationsA base regulation introduces new tariff and commercial measures. They do not originate from, or depend on other regulations. Base regulations, unless suspended, are valid from their entry into force to their end, or they can be open-ended. Measures under these regulations have the same validity, unless they are specifically suspended.\nModification regulationsThis regulation amends a base regulation. It can affect the tariff and commercial aspects of the updated regulation but it does not extend nor close the regulation itself. If the modification regulation has no end date of validity, its end date is defined by the end date of the regulations it modifies.\nProrogation regulationsProrogation regulations have no validity period of their own but extend the validity end date of a base or modification regulation. This means that the measures falling under the prorogued regulation are prorogued as well.\nA prorogation regulation can extend several regulations at different dates and a regulation can be extended several times.\nIf a regulation has been prorogued, its published end date does not take into account the prorogation and is different from its effective end date. Prorogation regulations are also called “extension regulations”.\nComplete abrogation regulationThis regulation abrogates a base, modification or FTS regulation. The abrogated regulation and its related measures are considered as “never existed”. This is the equivalent of cancelling a legal act. It is seldom used. It can be used, for instance, in the case of an erroneous publication. A complete abrogation regulation has no validity period.\nExplicit Abrogation regulationThis regulation abrogates a base, modification or full temporary stop regulation at a given date. It puts an end date to an open-ended regulation or brings the already existing end date of the regulation further back in time. The end date applies by definition to all measures under the abrogated regulation; unless these measures have a specific end dates.\nIf a regulation has been abrogated, its published end date does not take into account the abrogation and is different from its effective end date. An explicit abrogation regulation has no validity period; it ends the validity period of a measure-generating regulation or an FTS regulation.\nFull Temporary Stop regulationA FTS regulation suspends the applicability of a regulation for a period of time. This means that all the measures within the regulations are suspended as long as the FTS is valid. Once the FTS is abrogated or reaches its validity end date, all the measures of the suspended regulation become applicable again.\nPartial Temporary Stop regulationIf only some measures of a regulation must be suspended, a FTS regulation cannot be used as it suspends all the measures of the regulation. In this case, a PTS regulation is used to suspend specific measures within the regulation.\nPTS regulations are not introduced as independent TARIC objects, only their reference and their validity periods are introduced in the measures they suspend.\nRegulations in the UKWe are only using the base_regulation tables and not any of the others. This is because all of the other functionality offered by the EU’s Taric tables:\n\n\nis not equally represented in UK legal practices (i.e. we do not follow the same practices in initiating laws)\ncan be achieved via other means\nis performance-damaging (i.e. requiring complex join logics)\nbrings 200+ business rules that are not required\n\n\n        \n          \nRegulation type\nAlternative\n\nModification   tables\nUK   law will see a brand new piece of legislation coming in to replace an   existing regulation: we will simply use a new base regulation\n\nProrogation   regulations\nWe   will in most cases, unless explicitly required to do otherwise, leave   regulations and measures open-ended. The case for prorogation is therefore   massively watered down. Even if a measure is explicitly end-dated, the   measure’s end dates can simply be extended. We have checked with the European   Commission and there is no difference between modifying the end dates of a   measure and proroguing the measure-generating regulation.\n\nComplete   abrogations\nA   complete abrogation can only take place on a future regulation: if the   measures belonging to a regulation have already started, then it is not   possible to ‘just pretend they never existed’. If the regulation and any   associated measures are in the future, then they can just be deleted to   achieve the same aim. A complete abrogation is only ever used to correct an   error.\n\nExplicit   abrogations\nWhile   an explicit abrogation signals an earlier than expected end to a regulation,   this is a) infrequent as we will not be applying end dates to regulations in   general and b) replaced by simply terminating the associated measures.\n\nFull   \u0026 temporary stops\nThe   policy intent that sits behind these simply does not exist in the UK – there   is no recourse to temporarily pause a regulation. The only similar case on   point concerns the use of quota suspensions: these can be achieved by apply   quota suspension periods – see document on managing quotas.\n\n        \n      Regulation groupsEvery base regulation on the system (and we will only care in the future about base regulations) references a single regulation group. Modification regulations do not themselves have regulation groups – instead they reference the regulation group of the parent base regulation.\nThe regulation group represents a way of categorising regulations according to their purpose: it is much more than just a neat way of grouping regulations together: the groups mean something and if the tariff manager selects the wrong group, then the associated measures may not behave in the expected way.\nThere is a correlation table, listed on pages 124++ of the Taric user guide (revision 2) that links regulation group identifiers to the fields that need to be declared in Box 36 (Preference) on the SAD form, and by extension the measure types that can be used in those regulations.\nThe correlation tables allow traders to make specific declarations against the correct preferential duty / quota e.g. enter 100 to claim against a tariff preference.\nThe first thing to point out about this table is that it should be taken ever so slightly with a pinch of salt – it is wrong in a lot of places (though probably right at the time of writing), as will be evidenced below.\n\nThe marqueed line here shows that if a trader were to enter the term 123 into Box 36 of their declaration, then they would be able to take advantage of measure type 122 (non-preferential quota)  (as well as 464, which is just a notification that the product has been submitted to end use).\nIt also shows that those measures must have been entered against a regulation of type KON (non-preferential quotas). This IS enforced and tariff managers need to be aware of this when setting up regulations, otherwise the intended effect of the measure may not be achieved.\nThe regulation group data point is very sensitive – we should not build tools to allow tariff managers to modify this data, however we should review and adjust the content of the data, as it is critical to put across the genuine meaning, which is sometimes obfuscated in the EU’s descriptions.\n\n        \n          \nGroup\nProposed UK description\n\nCIT\nCITES\n\nDNC\nThird   country duties (MFNs)\n\nDUM\nTrade remedies (Anti-dumping and   anti-subsidy duties)\n\nFTA\nFTA   (preferences and quotas)\n\nKON\nNon-preferential   quotas (WTO, ATQ and safeguards)\n\nMLA\nImport   and export restrictions\n\nPRF\nPreferential   duties outside of FTAs\n\nPRS\nImport and export prohibitions\n\nSPG\nGeneralised   system of preferences (GSP)\n\nSUS\nTariff   suspensions and reliefs\n\nTXC\nRetaliatory   and safeguard duties\n\nUTS\nSupplementary   units\n\nVAU\nUnit   price (SPV), standard import value (SIV)\n\n        \n      Regulation role typesThese are used purely for the purposes of linking regulations in the TARIC application.\nChanging the end date of a regulation is identical to prorogating / abrogating in terms of its impact on the border systems and so we will not need to use them. However, they are used to illustrate the link between regulations and those that replace them (abrogation) and to show the justification for extending (prorogating).\nExtreme case with regard to variable duties – for VD for rice / cereals, whenever there is a change, the EU puts in place a new regulation and abrogates the previous. UK legislation will deliver the power to modify rapidly-changing duties without need for new legislation. In most cases, our regulations will not have end dates, so this is largely a moot point.\n\n        \n          \nID\nDescription\n\n1\nBase   regulation\n\n2\nProvisional   anti-dumping/countervailing duty\n\n3\nDefinitive   anti-dumping/countervailing duty\n\n4\nModification\n\n5\nProrogation\n\n6\nComplete   abrogation\n\n7\nExplicit   abrogation\n\n8\nRegulation   which temporarily suspends all another regulation (FTS - Full Temporary Stop)\n\n        \n      Linking to regulationsThe process of ‘ratifying’ a piece of legislation differs depending on the type of legislation involved. The majority of regulations that will impact the usage of the UK tariff are published as secondary legislation (statutory instruments or SIs). This applies to the setting of the MFN duties, managing annual quotas, trade agreements etc.\nThe only real outlier is with Trade Remedies anti-dumping (AD) and anti-subsidy (AS) regulation – these are typically published as Taxation Notices (tertiary legislation).\nUsing Taxation Notices instead of SIs makes a difference to the naming convention but also the timing. An SI can take months to go from 1st reading in the House of Commons through to execution – depending on whether it is an affirmative or negative procedure, whereas a public notice that underpins AS/AD duties can be decided overnight on the say-so of the Secretary of State. In practice the tariff management team are likely to receive ~1 week notice for implementing anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duties.\nThere is an additional point to bear in mind with the types of regulations. Most regulations will eventually lodge somewhere on legislation.gov.uk, whereas public notices will be published as flat HTML pages on gov.uk.\nThis is important when defining the URL where the original document can be found (online), linked to from the UK Trade Tariff Service.\nPre-EU-Exit, the UK Trade Tariff Service has links out to the EU regulations that underpin a measure. Clicking on the regulation link in the lightbox navigates the user to the EUR-LEX website which houses all EU documents. There are no fields in the core regulation schema that define the URL of the regulation: this is inferred from various properties that are consistent across all regulations and made possible by the fact that all regulations are housed on EUR-LEX according to a predefined URL structure.\nThe EUR-LEX URL is defined according to the values stored in two fields which are of critical importance to the EU, but will be largely meaningless to the UK:\n* officialjournal_number\n* officialjournal_page\n* …as well as the year of the regulation\n\nTo note – the diagram above shows two regulations that are applicable to a measure. This is (first) the modification regulation R1006/11 overlaid on top of the original base regulation R2658/97.\nThis shows that the regulation’s box official journal number is L 282 and the official journal page is 0001. The year of the regulation is 2011. These three fields are then inserted into a boilerplate URL structure as follows:\nhttp://eur-lex.europa.eu/search.html?whOJ=NO_OJ%3D282,YEAR_OJ%3D2011,PAGE_FIRST%3D0001\u0026DB_COLL_OJ=oj-l\u0026type=advanced\u0026lang=en\nThis then gives a search result on EUR-LEX which surfaces the necessary OJ entry according to the criteria specified against that regualtion.\nIn the UKClearly the OJ journal and page and the URL on EUR-LEX are of no value to future UK legislation URLs. An alternative means of providing the data to the Trade Tariff Service needs to be implemented, as follows:\n\n\nWe populate the “OJ” data going into UK regulations as follows:\n\n\nofficialjournal_number = “1”\nofficialjournal_page = “1”\n\nTwo additional fields, that are not in the EU’s core regulation schema are required:\n\n\npublic_identifier – the regulation descriptor, as will appear on the Trade Tariff Service \nurl – the URL that is linked to from the regulation / legal base link.\n\nThese are then combined into the information_text field in the XML, separated by pipe characters (|):\n\u003coub:information.text\u003eRegulation title|Public identifier|https://url\u003c/oub.information.text\u003e\n\nIdentifying regulationsUnder EU jurisdiction, the identification of the legal act is composed of four elements:\n\n        \n          \nChar(s)\nUsage\n\n1\nTo   contain the alphabetic regulation type identifier as listed below.\n\n2-3\nTo   contain a 2-digit reference to the year (e.g. 21, 22).\n\n4-7\nTo   contain a sequential identifier starting at 0000. Ideally this would, where   possible equate to the public identifier of the regulation (e.g. for statutory instrument SI 2012/1312, this would be 1312).\n\n8\nThe suffix: this is used to split regulations logically although they have been published as one piece of legislation (for instance, for supporting different validity periods within the one regulation or allowing the same publication to be used in mutliple regulation groups). The value here is usually “0”, but documents in EU legislation can be very complex, and this digit may extend through the numerical digits.\n\n        \n      In the tariff database, to translate regulation identifiers into database IDs, it’s necessary to transpose the characters as follows:\n\nThe UK and the EU have very different ways of managing legislation, meaning that the way in which the EU has decided to structure its regulation IDs is not suited to the UK: we do not distinguish between regulations, decisions, agreements etc, therefore the prefix convention is less than useful to the UK.\nIn fact, the only prefix definition that we will carry forward is ‘C’: this is used to denote a draft regulation, i.e. one where the measures do not yet take legal effect. This is the only one of 6 subdivisions of regulations that has actual functional effect: the others are labels only.\nThe table identifies how the UK will structure its regulation identifiers – please note: this is an internal identifier only. It is not intended to be displayed to members of the public. Thr public_identifier field is used to provide a public facing identifier for the regulation. It is critical that every regulation is provided a regulation identifier of exactly 8 digits (not 7 not 9).\n\n        \n          \nPrefix\nUsage\n\nC\nDraft   regulation\n\nP\nPreferential   Trade Agreement / FTA\n\nU\nUnilateral   preferences (GSP)\n\nS\nSuspensions   and reliefs\n\nX\nImport   and Export control\n\nN\nTrade   remedies\n\nM\nMFN\n\nQ\nQuotas\n\nA\nAgri   measures\n\n        \n      Example – Trade agreement regulation in 2 parts (P2113720 / P2113721)This would be referenced with a public identifier of 2021 No. 1372.\n\n        \n          \nChar(s)\nMeaning\n\nP\nPreferential   Trade Agreement / FTA\n\n21\nfrom   2021\n\n1372\nThe   unique identifier of the SI\n\n0\nDocument   part 0 (maybe used for tariff preference measures \u0026 quotas)\n\n        \n      \n        \n          \nChar(s)\nMeaning\n\nP\nPreferential   Trade Agreement / FTA\n\n21\nfrom   2021\n\n1372\nThe   unique identifier of the SI\n\n1\nDocument   part 1 (maybe used for supplementary units)\n\n        \n      Draft regulationsDraft regulations are unique, inasmuch as they are ‘live’ but the measures that are associates with them do not take effect – they have no executive power and will not show up as active measures in the border systems or on the trade tariff service\nDraft regulations are identified by the prefix ‘C’ – we are continuing to use these draft regulations in the UK tariff because of the special properties that they have.\nDraft regulations are especially useful for measures whose start date / legislative underpinning has not yet been decided, but out of expedience, it is necessary to start with measure data entry. If a draft regulation is not used, then any measures created on the Tariff Application will be ‘live’ and visible on the Trade Tariff Service, even if the user needs to move the time forward to see them.\nApproved flagA regulation can either be “approved” or “not approved”. If a regulation is “not approved”, none of the measures that link to it will be active at the border, regardless of their validity dates. So the “approved” flag is like an on/off switch for all of the measures associated with a regulation.\nThe use case is that sometimes it is appropriate to prepare and send new policy to border systems in advance before the legislation has been written or formally accepted by Parliament. In these cases, a draft regulation in a “not approved” state can be sent with all of the measures that it creates, and then when the legislation is signed off by Parliament the regulation can be simply updated to be “approved” and all of the measures become live.\n(The advantage of doing this over just not sending the measures until it is signed is that allows traders and other users to see what the changes will be when they are signed off by Parliament without any risk that they will accidentally be applied at the border.)\nThe approved flag is hence not related to the “status” field or the tariff workflow – it is possible to have a “published” regulation that is “not approved”, or a “unpublished” regulation that is “approved”.\nThe approved flag follows the following rules:\n\n\nOnly “draft regulations” can be “not approved”. A “draft regulation” is any regulation with an ID that starts with a “C”. Other types of regulations must always be “approved”.\nThe approved flag can only be switched from “not approved” to “approved”. Once a regulation has been “approved”, it cannot subsequently be updated to be “not approved”. \n\n\n","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-data-structures/regulations.html"},"21":{"title":"Quota associations","content":"Quota associations\n\n\nWhat are quota associations?\n\n\nKey data fields for associations\n\n\nKey examples - Equivalence associations (EQ)\n\n\nKey examples - Normal associations (NM)\n\n\nManaging quota associations in TAP\n\n\nKey user needs – quota associations\n\n\nKey business rules – quota associations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA quota association is used to link together one main quota and one or more sub quotas, so that drawing down on one quota will have an impact on another.\n\nWhat are quota associations?\n\nA quota association is used as a mechanism in Taric to link together quotas in such a way that the drawing down on that quota by a trader will then have an impact on another.\nThe detail of the trade instruments that necessitate and make use of this function are described in detail below.\nThe quota association links together two or more quotas’ quota definitions, which are time-bound periods, often of exactly one year, but sometimes shorter.\nThe association defines the link between one and only one main quota and one or more sub quotas. These are sometimes referred to respectively as parent and child quotas, though main and sub are the traditional Taric terms.\nThere are currently 28 main quotas that are linked to sub quotas via their definitions.\n\n\nWhere are quota associations used?\nIn the EU tariff, there are a number of key product areas where quota associations are used (or potentially could be used if such policy were adopted):\nHow we choose to adopt these in the UK tariff will depend on the emerging UK trade policy, for example there are a number of quota associations that are:\n\n\npart of trade agreements that we are yet to transition or\nhave been provisionally written out of the UK equivalent.\n\nThese instances are discussed in detail on subsequent pages.\n\nLive from Day One\n\n\nLamb, sheep and goat meat (WTO quota)\nBeef (WTO quota)\nOrange juice (Israel)\n\n\nLive from Day One in theory\n\n\nSteel (safeguards)*\nClothing (C. America quota of quotas)**\n\n\nAgreements not yet transitioned\n\n\nBison meat (Canada)\nEggs and egg albumin (Mexico)\n\n\nNo longer required\n\n\nTomatoes (Morocco)\n\n\nKey data fields for associationsQuota associations – key data fields\nThe data model, if not the underlying concepts for quota associations, is simple.\n\nThe key fields are defined in the box surrounded by the red dashed marquee in the diagram above.\n\n\nan association links to a single main (parent) quota definition and a single sub (child) definition: these definitions define the quota order number, which is a property of the definition as well as the time extent: the association will last as long as the definitions. In most cases, the definitions of main and sub quota are equally long, however Moroccan tomatoes is the exception: while the complex Moroccan tomato quota will not be carried forward into the UK tariff, it deserves and receives some explanation in this training pack.\nan association then has a relation type, defined below, and a coefficient, also explained below.\n\n2 relation types: EQ and NM\nThere are two relation type values that are used to define quota associations: EQ (equivalent to main quota and NM normal). The two relation types define the two main uses of quota associations.\nQuota associations are used:\n\n\nto provide the opportunity to spread a quota balance across multiple order numbers and to apply a weighting to the weight or volume of the individual products (relation type EQ). The weighting is defined in the corresponding coefficient field\nto apply a maximum quota volume to subsidiary products (or periods) within a parent group’s volume (relation type NM)\nto allow goods to be traded evenly across multiple in-year definition periods and for balances to be transferred into a future period.\nThe TARIC3 IDS Elements guide document (essential reading) describes the possible relation types as per the screen grab to below.\n\n\n\n\nThese different types were first introduced in 2010. The following rules apply:\n\n\nthe value assigned to the coefficient field is always 1.00 where the relation type is “NM”.\nthe values assigned to the coefficient field is always something other than 1.00 where the relation type is “EQ”.\n\nTherefore, EQ is used to relate quota order numbers where volume or weight is to be interpreted differently via a simple co-efficient.\nNM is used where weight or volume is the same across each related definition, however a maximum weight / volume is applied to specific commodity codes in the sub-quota, or in the case of beef WTO quotas, to allow balance to be shared equitably across an entire year (see below).\n\nKey examples - Equivalence associations (EQ)Sheep and goat meat – WTO quota\n\n\n\nThis is the poster boy for quota associations – the most crucial for trade of the remaining associations, given the emotional importance of the commodities involved and the number of countries impacted.\nThe details of the trade in sheep and goat meat are set out in the EU’s Regulation 1354 of 2011 and subsequent documents which cover the opening annual WTO Union tariff quotas for sheepmeat and goatmeat – the mechanism is copied into the UK tariff.\nThe reason why equivalence associations are used in this set of quotas is that there are three types of products to be traded (each represented by multiple commodities) whose imports are to be treated different, depending on what product they are\nIt is considered that 1kg of meat off the bone is to count less than 1kg of meat on the bone when determining quota allocations.\nIn the EU, this covers imports from Greenland, Argentina, Australia, Chile, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, New Zealand, Turkey, Uruguay, WTO Member states and Erga Omnes.\nIn the UK, additional countries will be added to this list dependent on whether the trade deals with those countries have gone through, e.g. Bosnia-Herzegovina.\nPlease be aware also of Chile, where the volumes are shared with a preferential quota.\n\n\n\n\nPage 3 of the noted regulation shows the effect and implementation of quota associations (EQ type).\nThe red marquee above shows the details of this specific sheep and goat meat quota for New Zealand (the same applies to other countries).\nThe EU is allowed to import 228,254 tonnes of meat from New Zealand annually. The notes above the final column are instrumental – “in tonnes of carcase weight equivalent” illustrates there is a calculation to undertake for goods of various different types in order to determine “what constitutes a tonne”.\nIn this case bone-in carcases are counted as 1 tonne, boneless mutton / sheep counts as 1.81 tonnes and boneless lamb counts as 1.67 tonnes. These values are reflected in the coefficients on the printed regulation and also in the quota associations table in the database (orange marquee). This setup is echoed with Bison meat (Canada).\n\n\nPreferential beef quotas\n\n\nThere are also beef quotas that behave somewhat similarly to the lamb quotas already defined, though not precisely the same – please take care also to note the differences between these quotas and the core WTO beef quotas described later in this document that behave quite differently and use associations for very different purposes.\nThe quotas used in the EUs are:\n\n\n097308 and 097300 (Central America)\n097314 and 097315 (Nicaragua)\n097209 and 097210 (Peru)\n\nUsing the C. America quotas as an example, the following data is set up – replicated for Nicaragua and Peru, though the Peru commodity codes are more specific:\n\n\nIn summary\nThis effectively means that every single good imported on these three quotas is treated as being 1.421 times its actual weight – other than convention, it is not clear why the quota volumes were just not set differently in the first place. Each of the underlying regulations features a footnote re: beef products as follows:\n“Expressed in carcase weight equivalent as follows: 100 kg of bone-in meat shall be equivalent to 70 kg1 of boneless meat.”\nEggs from Mexico (TBC)\n\n\nThere are two EU main quotas related to egg products currently in place, that utilise an equivalent association to determine the declarable weight of goods, depending on the commodity type.\nThe two main quotas  09.1832 and 09.1869, respectively for egg yolks or eggs not in shell and egg albumin, use the equivalence association to calculate egg weights according to the UCC code calculation\n\n\nBison from Canada (TBC)\n\n\n\nThe arrangement that the EU has for the importation of bison from Canada is very similar to that used on WTO quotas from multiple countries worldwide\nPlease note that, at the time of writing, the Canada (CETA) trade agreement has not been carried over to the UK Tariff and is not imminent.\nThe idea is to differentiate between different cuts of meat: those considered of higher value and those considered of lower value\nQuota associations are applied to provide an equivalence for the various product types, as follows: \n\n\nKey examples - Normal associations (NM)Beef WTO quotas\n\n\nThere are a number of quotas that have been set up to facilitate the trade in beef products according to the EU’s WTO schedule.\nThe primary quota arrangement caters for imports from the following origins:\n\n\nArgentina\nAustralia\nCanada\nNew Zealand\nUnited States of America\nUruguay\n\nThe quota is an annual quota split into 4 equal quarters running from:\n\n\n1st July to 30th September\n1st October to 31st December\n1st January to 31st March\n1st April to 30th June\n\n\nMain quota = 09.2201, sub quota = 09.2202 Regulation R0481/12 – Beef (AR, CA, US, UY, AU, NZ)\nCOMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 481/2012 of 7 June 2012 laying down rules for the management of a tariff quota for high-quality beef.\n\nArticle 2 - Management of the tariff quota\n\n\nThe tariff quota shall be managed on a first-come, first- served basis in accordance with Articles 308a and 308b and Article 308c(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93. No import licences shall be required. \nThe tariff quota shall be managed as a parent tariff quota under order number 09.2201 with four quarterly sub-tariff quotas under order number 09.2202.  The benefit from the tariff quota can be granted only by applying for order number 09.2202 referring to the sub-tariff quotas. \nThe drawings on the sub-tariff quotas until 30 September, 31 December and 31 March shall be stopped respectively on the fifth working day of the Commission in November, February and May. Their unused balances shall be added to the quantities for the quarterly sub-tariff quotas starting respectively on 1 October, 1 January and 1 April. No unused balance at the end of a quota year shall be transferred to another quota year. \n\n\nParent quota order number and definitions\n\n\nOriginal quota order number 09.2201 was set up from 1st July 2012 with an empty validity end date\nParent quota 09.2201 set up with definition periods one per year, running from 1st July to 30th June – for some reason this only started in 2015, not 2012.\n\n\nChild quota order number and definitions\n\n\nOriginal child quota order number 09.2202 also set up from 1st July 2012 with an empty validity end date\n4 definitions per year on 09.2202, running from:\n\n\n1st July to 30th September\n1st October to 31st December\n1st January to 31st March\n1st April to 30th June\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are quota associations between the parent 09.2201 and child 09.2202 quota definitions\nThese associations are made on each quota definition with type NM (normal) and coefficient of 1.0000\nThe 4 sub-quota definition periods are associated with the single annual parent quota definition (repeated [marketing]-yearly – July to June)\nThis year, a total volume of 45000000.00 KGM is assigned to the parent: this is split into 4 equal chunks of 11250000.00 KGM for each sub-quota period\n\n\nMain quota definition (parent)\n\n\nSub quota definitions (child)\n\n\nAll measures are set against the sub quota 09.2202\nAs per the regulation, the benefit from the tariff quota can be granted only by applying for order number 09.2202 referring to the sub-tariff quotas.\nThere are no measures against the parent quota 09.2201.\nThe start and end dates of the measures line up with the start and end dates of the quota definitions\n\nPurpose of beef quota associations\n\n\nThe purpose of the beef quota associations is to ensure that any balance left over at the end of a quota definition period is made available to the subsequent definition period within that marketing year.\nFor example balance from quarter 1 can be carried forward into quarter 2, from Q2 into Q3 and from Q3 into Q4\nBalance may not be carried forward from year to year however.\nAlthough it may seem that this function is thematically detached from the nature of the quota association, this is just how the border systems function in response: QAM (HMRC’s border system’s Quota Allocation Module) has been constructed to allow for this specific functionality\n\n\nOrange juice from Israel\n\n\nThe Israel orange juice quota association is designed to limit the import of a certain range of orange juice commodity codes into the EU (and in future the UK). As per the diagram below, taken from the EU’s regulation 1154/2009, main quota 09.1331 is set up to accept a large volume (35,000 tonnes) of all orange juice commodities\nSub quota 09.1333 is set up to allow a max of 21,280 tonnnes of juice in smaller containers\nDue to the association, when a trader brings in goods against either of the quotas, the main quota is decremented: when the sub quota (small containers) is exhausted, traders may still continue to bring goods in on the main quota, provided they are not the commodities that identify small containers of orange juice.\nThis quota is set up with relation type NM (Normal – restrictive to main quota), such that a quantitive limit is applied to the sub quota\nThe coefficient is set to 1.00000, meaning that drawing down 1kg on the subquota will also draw down 1kg on the parent with no equivalence calculation.\n\n\n\nSteel safeguards – most of the world\nBackground to steel safeguards\n\n\nIn 2017, POTUS applied a swingeing import duty on steel, aluminium and tin goods coming into the USA from most overseas countries, in an avowed attempt to save the US steel industry from ‘dumping’ of cheap steel from abroad. This duty remains in place to this day.\nThe impact on global steel trade has been dramatic – suddenly, all the steel which would have found a buyer on the US market could not be sold, and traders needed to find a buyer. This therefore led to an immediate and hugely distorted over-supply of goods from overseas onto the EU market.\nTherefore the EU introduced similar measures, in the first year a replica of the US charges, but in the second, as it became clear that the balance of trade was complex to introduce, as well as facing into a potential trade dispute from nations that had done no wrong, the EU introduced a complex quota-based system to ensure that the volume of such goods coming into the Union was appropriately balanced.\nThis quota system has since become even more nuanced, resulting in the new measures introduced in October 2019, on which the UK will be basing our response.\n\nSteel safeguards and quota associations\n\n\nThe steel safeguards are broken into 28 product categories, of which c. 20 will be carried over into the UK’s safeguard response.\nCategories 1, 13 and 16 are special and require quota associations to ensure that the policy is executed to its fullest.\nBefore detailing this, it is worth reiterating how the DIT and HMRC systems connect and how this changes from the current setup with the EU.\nThe important piece to note here is that the UK will be allocating its own quotas after EU Exit, and not the EU.\nHMRC has introduced a new system called QAM (Quota Allocation Module) which allocates quota requests on importers’ declarations.\nAny new functionality needs to be coded from scratch in the UK: safeguard quotas are such new functionality: as it stands (Dec 19), CDS is not yet ready to allocate this kind of quota association.\n\n\nWhat’s special about steel safeguards?\nThe EU introduced a new concept for steel safeguards that ensures that a maximum volume is assigned to imports from individual countries; i.e. a single country cannot dominate a quota to the exclusion of all others – the purpose is to maintain some kind of equitable trade flow across the globe.\n\nHow does this work?\n\n\nA main quota is set up with a large, globally available volume;\nMultiple sub-quotas are set up with volumes that are a specific percentage of the parent (but in total add up to significantly more that the parent’s total)\nIn this real example (EU category 13), imports from no country are allowed to exceed 33.33%; hence the main quota is set up with 100% (141,103,760.00 KGM), and 6 sub-quotas are set up with 33.33% (42,331,128.00 KGM)\n\n\n\n\nSafeguard national limits are artificial – they cannot be applied to every single countryThey are applied solely to those countries that are liable to exceed the mandated threshold via a NM-type sub quota association\n\nUK interpretation of steel safeguards\nThe UK is likely to interpret the steel safeguards regulation as follows:\n\nCategory 1 - Non Alloy and Other Alloy Hot Rolled Sheets and Strips \n\n\nAll year round, there will be a limit of 75% max per country limit applied to quotas applied to category 1.\nThe expectation is that the EU will be the only bloc that threatens to get near this 75% limit.\n\n\nCategory 13 - Rebars \u0026 Category 16 - Non Alloy and Other Alloy Wire Rod\n \n\n\nThe steel safeguard year runs from July 1st to June 30th. The year is typically broken into 4 quarters (July to Sep, Oct to Dec, Jan to Mar, Apr to Jun).\nFor these categories, there will be no association of quotas, as the max does not apply, however on quarter 4, Apr to Jun, the ‘global’ quota will be opened up to other large exporters which will have a maximum 30% threshold applied, as per the EU example 2 slides prior to this.\nAs previously described, this cannot yet be managed via allocation in QAM, though the solution is in delivery.\nThe UK will set up quota associations in the same way as the EU does once the functionality has been delivered.\n\nC. America quota of quotas\nQuota of quota – clothes from C. America\n\n\n\nApplicable to Nicaragua and El Salvador, a function known as a ‘quota of quotas’ has been implemented to apply a maximum import volume across multiple quotas.\nThe intent is expressed as follows:For the tariff quotas with quota order numbers from 09.7105 to 09.7138, the global yearly quota volume may not exceed the following number of items (pairs) for the respective calendar year.with a table beneath it expressing the maximum overall volume across multiple quotas.\nThere are two such quotas of quotas for Nicaragua and a single quota of quota for El Salvador.\nPlease note – this requirement is more theoretical than practical: it has not been implemented in the EU tariff since 2015, and although the data appears to be present for 2020, it may yet be removed as unnecessary - i.e. it is understood as a regulatory requirement, however the legislated volumes are never even close to being met, therefore the function is disabled.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a single quota (or quota of quotas) to which a master overall volume is assigned. For 2020, the volumes are 12,687,500 items of clothing from Nicaragua.\nCrucially, this is purely a blanket quota exercising a maximum threshold: there are no commodities applied to the master quota: traders are also not expected to reference 09.7104 on their declarations.\nThe quota then has a NM type relationship with the 34 individual quotas that are afforded a threshold by the main quota. On the diagram, there is only one line, but there are 34 individual associations.\nQuota volumes are applied to the individual quotas, as are related commodities.\nFor 2020, according to legislation, the sum of the initial quota volumes for the 34 quotas is 28,854,000.00 items (the overall Quota of Quota maximum is c. 43% of this).\n\nTomatoes from Morocco \u0026 Western Sahara – a little bit special\n\n\nThe EU’s COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 812/2012 of 12 September 2012 amending Council Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 as regards tariff quotas of the Union for certain agricultural and processed agricultural products originating in Morocco introduced legislation that caused a great deal of complexity with regard to quota associations that has no parallel in the Tariff.\nIt has been decided to not carry this over into the UK Tariff, as the complexities of adminstering the quotas are not warranted: the UK’s tomato agriculture is far less vital to the economy than equivalents in Southern Europe, which were served by this policy.\nThere are two main features of the Moroccan quotas which are rarely replicated elsewhere:\n\n\nfirstly, there are multiple subquotas to a single main quota, described on the screens below\nsecondly, a unique ‘topup’ mechanism exists to feed one quota with balance from another quota, if such a remainder exists\n\nIf that were not complex enough, it also uses the Entry Price System to work out the applicable in quota duties.\nThe legislation is documented in detail on the following pages.\n\nRegulation R0812/12 – Tomatoes (Morocco)\nCOMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 812/2012 of 12 September 2012 amending Council Regulation (EC) No 747/2001 as regards tariff quotas of the Union for certain agricultural and processed agricultural products originating in Morocco\n\nArticle 3a - Special provisions for the tariff quotas for tomatoes originating in Morocco (and later Western Sahara)\nFor tomatoes of CN code 0702 00 00 placed into free circulation in every period from 1 October to 31 May (hereinafter “marketing year”), drawings on the monthly tariff quotas laid down in Annex II under order number 09.1104 from 1 October to 31 December and from 1 January to 31 March respectively, shall be stopped each year on 15 January and on the second working day in the Commission following 1 April.\nOn the following working day in the Commission, the Commission services will determine the unused balance of each of these tariff quotas and will make available that unused balance within the additional tariff quota applicable for that marketing year under the order number 09.1112.\nFrom the dates on which the monthly tariff quotas are stopped, any retroactive drawings from any of the stopped monthly tariff quotas applicable during the months of November, December and January to March, and any returns of unused volumes to any of the stopped monthly tariff quotas shall be made on the additional tariff quota applicable under the order number 09.1112 for that marketing year.\n\nMaster quota order number\n\n\nQuota order number 09.1104 is set up from June 2005 with 8 definition periods running from start of November to end of May (1 month each)\n\n\nParent quota order number and definitions\n\n\nOriginal quota order number 09.1112 was set up from 1st Nov 2003. This was superseded in the following years but effectively has been live since then with no validity end date\nParent quota 09.1112 has been set up with definition periods one per year, running for 7 months each from 1st Nov to 31st May ever since 2004.\n\n\nChild quota order number and definitions\n\n\nChild quota order number 09.1193 was set up on 1st November 2012 – single record only\nChild order number 09.1193 has 7 order definitions per marketing year (start of Nov to end of May) – these are all monthly, running in these periods:\n\n\n1st Nov to 30th Nov\n1st Dec to 31st Dec\n1st Jan to 31st Jan\n1st Feb to 28th Feb (or 29th)\n1st Mar to 31st Mar\n1st Apr to 30th Apr\n1st May to 31st May\n\n\n\n\nQuota associations\nFor marketing year 1st Nov 2017 to 31st May 2018 (and replicated thereafter), each of the sub-quota’s definitions (from 09.1193) are associated to the parent definition (09.1112) for that year.\n\n\n\nWe will be abandoning this complexity, as the import of tomatoes into the UK is not as emotive or so vital for UK tomato growers’ ability to flourish.\nWe will continue to use two quotas, but both without associations, 09.1104 and 09.1193 running for 8 and 7 months respectively with single definition periods (and hence a single quota volume each accessible throughout that entire period)\n\nManaging quota associations in TAP[Not yet sure if this will go in a different section so I have omitted this from this page for now - This section is covered in pages 13-19 in the powerpoint]\nKey user needs – quota associations\n        \n          \n\nAs a …\n\nI want to…\n\nSo that …\n\nMoSCoW\n\n\nUK Tariff Manager\n\nview a list of all active quota   associations\n\nI can select and decide the next   appropriate actions to be performed.\n\nMust Have\n\n\nUK Tariff Manager\n\ncreate a new quota associations\n\nI can present it on the system for   future association purposes.\n\nMust Have\n\n\nUK Tariff Manager\n\nonly view \u0026 select future quota   associations\n\nI can’t edit quota associations that   has already been triggered.\n\nMust Have\n\n\nUK Tariff Manager\n\ndelete a future quota associations\n\nthe system will not activate the   associated quota definitions incorrectly.\n\nMust Have\n\n\nUK Tariff Manager\n\nhave a workflow process\n\nall quota blocking changes can be   validated and approved before being sent to CDS.\n\nMust Have\n\n\nUK Tariff Manager\n\nhave the system validate relevant   business rules accordingly\n\nIt won’t cause errors when validated in   CDS.\n\nShould Have\n\n\nUK Tariff Manager\n\nbe able to view all available parent   and child definitions\n\nI can create new quota associations   easily and quickly.\n\nMust Have\n\n\nUK Tariff Manager\n\nbe able to enter/select the correct   relation type values\n\nthe correct weighting is reflected on   the respective products.\n\nMust Have\n\n\nUK Tariff Manager\n\nonly view quota definitions in the last   2 years\n\nI won’t inundated with too much   information.\n\nShould Have\n\n        \n      Key business rules – quota associations\n        \n          \n\n#\n\nRule\n\nNotes\n\nMoSCoW\n\n\nQA1\n\nThe association between two quota   definitions must be unique.\n\nRequired\n\nMust   Have     - This is in order that the sub   quota will only be drawn down once by a trader.\n\n\nQA2\n\nThe sub-quota’s validity period   must be entirely enclosed within the validity period of the main quota.\n\nRequired\n\nMust   Have     -    User will need an active main quota in order for association to be   assigned to it.\n\n\nQA3\n\nWhen converted to the measurement   unit of the main quota, the volume of a sub-quota must always be lower than   or equal to the volume of the main quota.\n\nRequired\n\nMust   Have     - The main quota is designed to   have the max volume which will be drawdown-ed by the subs.\n\n\nQA4\n\nWhenever a sub-quota receives a   coefficient, this has to be a strictly positive decimal number.

This term refers to the certificates, licences, and non-paper conditions that are stored in certificate tables and are required to bring goods through customs.\n\nIntroduction to certificatesWhat are certificates?The certificates tables store all the certificates, licences and other conditions that are referenced through measure conditions to make the import or export of a good conditional on the provision of a document, declaration or exemption.  The ‘certificate’ is usually a physical or digital document (for example a licence or official certificate), but it can also be a non-document condition. A good example of a ‘non-document’ condition is:\nY037 - Goods exempted from the prohibition – biathlon equipment\nHere the condition references a property of the good being imported, and not an accompanying document. These rare cases are typically linked to measures using the measure_condition_code “Y”.   Refer to measure conditions for more detail.\n\nWhat certificates are notA certificate is not a representation of the actual document itself.  The database stores only a certificate code (4-digits) and a description of that code.\nStructure of certificates and certificate typesXML Structure\u003cxs:simpleType name=\"CertificateCode\"\u003e\n    \u003cxs:restriction base=\"xs:string\"\u003e\n            \u003cxs:length value=\"3\"/\u003e\n            \u003cxs:pattern value=\"[A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9]\"/\u003e\n    \u003c/xs:restriction\u003e\n\u003c/xs:simpleType\u003e\n\u003cxs:simpleType name=\"CertificateTypeCode\"\u003e\n    \u003cxs:restriction base=\"xs:string\"\u003e\n            \u003cxs:length value=\"1\"/\u003e\n            \u003cxs:pattern value=\"[A-Z0-9]\"/\u003e\n    \u003c/xs:restriction\u003e\n\u003c/xs:simpleType\u003e\nSimilar to footnotes and additional codes, certificates consist of a type code and then a specific code when joined together form the unique code of the certificate.  For example, the footnote C656 is constructed of a type code C and a specific certificate code 656 – the entire certificate is known as C656.\nCertificate type codes are always 1 digit or character in length from any uppercase alphanumeric character.\nHistorically, the alphabetical certificate type codes have been used for EU-wide certificates: the numeric certificate type codes are used for national measures.\nCertificate codes typically use numeric IDs from 001 to 999 and can be reused across multiple certificate type codes. While the schema allows for alphabetical certificate codes, these are rarely used - there are 11 instances of certificate codes using alpha instead of numeric digits.  Certificate codes must be three digits in length.\nCertificate type codes\n        \n          \nCode\nDescription\n\n9\nNational   document\n\nA\nCertificate of authenticity\n\nC\nOther   certificates\n\nD\nAnti-dumping, countervailing   document\n\nE\nExport   certificate, licence or document from country of origin\n\nH\nHANDI,   LOOMS certificate\n\nI\nSurveillance   certificate, licence or document issued by one of the Member States\n\nK\nTariff   quota\n\nL\nImport   certificate, licence or document\n\nN\nUN/EDIFACT   certificates\n\nP\nIngredients\n\nR\nExport   refunds\n\nU\nProofs   of origin\n\nX\nExport   licence\n\nY\nParticular   provisions\n\nZ\nMore   certificates\n\n        \n      Two of the most frequently used code types are C (other certificates) and Y (particular provisions) – these are catch-all types for the large proportion of condition needs.\n\nBusiness rules - Certificate types and CertificatesCertificate types\n        \n          \nID\nDescription\nNotes\n\nCET1\nThe   type of the certificate must be unique.\nLow priority - there   will be few requirements to modify certificate types.\n\nCET2\nThe   certificate type cannot be deleted if it is used in a certificate.\nLow priority - there   will be few requirements to modify certificate types.\n\nCET3\nThe   start date must be less than or equal to the end date.\nLow priority - there   will be few requirements to modify certificate types.\n\n        \n      Certificates\n        \n          \nID\nDescription\nNotes\n\nCE1\nThe   referenced certificate type must exist.\nMedium priority - will be picked from a list, therefore unlikely to fail.\n\nCE2\nThe   combination of certificate type and certificate code must be unique.\nHigh priority.\n\nCE3\nThe   start date must be less than or equal to the end date.\nMedium priority.\n\nCE4\nIf   a certificate is used in a measure condition then the validity period of the certificate must span the validity period of the measure.\nMedium priority - as with all such things – just do not end-date certificates.\n\nCE5\nThe certificate cannot be deleted if it is used in a measure condition.\nLow priority do not delete conditions unless absolutely required.\n\nCE6\nAt   least one description record is mandatory.

This entity, derived from the geographical_areas view may itself be:\n\n\na single country (like Namibia)\na group of countries (like Cariforum, a Caribbean trading bloc)\na region – a country that has yet to be fully incorporated, like Kosovo, which remains partially recognised.\n\nA quota may be assigned to multiple geographical area entities.  A geographical area that is defined as being a country group will have one or more countries (or regions) designated as members of that country group.\nIdentifying geographical areasAn identifier for a country group geographical_area_id is structured depending on the type of area.\nThe geographical code field dictates what type of geographical area is involved:\n\n\n0 Country\n1 Country group\n2 Region\n\nFor all countries and regions, the code is a 2-digit upper-case alphabetical string.\nFor countries, this is based on the international standard ISO_3166-1\nFor regions (unincorporated states) the code is typically a 2-digit string beginning with X, followed by the first letter of the country.  For country groups, the code is an alpha-numeric string of 4-digits.\nFor country groups set up by the EU, these 4-digit strings are always numeric, for example 1001 = Worldwide (Erga Omnes)\nNationally setup groups are alpha-numeric, for example F006 (Phytosanitary certificates)\nCountry groupsThe previous example (F006 Phytosanitary certificates) shows that the country groups do not have to align to a globally understood trading entity like EU (1011), CARIFORUM (1033) or GSP LDC (2005).\nThe fundamental  operation of Taric and TAP is to produce measures, which can be connected to just one single geographical area, it is simpler to create a group of countries and apply the measure to that group and not the individual countries.\nSome geographical areas are created to implement specific elements of trade policy, for example to execute the regulations associated with handloomed products.   A group has been set up to accommodate the countries to which a quota applies for such products – the name of the group is “Silk or cotton handloom products”.\n\nGeographical area membershipGeographical areas that represent country groups (area code 1) are designed to include member countries.\nA geographical area group can only contain regions or countries (area codes 0 and 2), not other geographical area groups. A geographical area’s membership of a country group has a start date and where required an end date.\nThere are a few  cases where membership of geographical areas change. For example, countries move in and out of Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) tiers from year to year as they progress or decline economically.\nSteel safeguards are assigned to country groups created specifically for the purpose of applying punitive duties against large numbers of countries - these groups tend to change from year to year.\nCountry groups could also be created to apply specific regulatory controls.\nRelationship of measures to geographical areas\n\nAll measures are assigned to precisely one geographical area.\nThat area may be a country, region (non-incorporated country) or a group of countries.\nIf the geographical area is a country group, then it is possible to exclude (one or more) members of that country group from the measure via inclusion in the measure_excluded_geographical_areas table.\nThe excluded country must be a member of that group.\nNote: both the excluded_geographical_area and geographical_area_id fields refer to the excluded country, not the group.\n\nRelationship of quotas to geographical areas\n\nAll quotas need to be represented both as measures and within the structures related to quotas.\nWith licensed quotas, these are only represented by quotas.\nThe relationship of geographical areas to quotas needs to be reflected in both the measures and quotas structures (except for licensed quotas).\nTherefore both the relationship of quotas to their origins and measures to the related geographical areas needs to be managed and synchronised in the data creation.\n\nKey business processing rules – geographical areas\n        \n          \nID\nRule\n\nGA1\nThe combination geographical area ID plus the validity start date must be unique.\n\nGA2\nThe start date must be less than or equal to the end date.\n\nGA3\nAt least one description record is mandatory. The start date of the first description period must be equal to the start date of the geographical area. Two descriptions may not have the same start date. The start date of the description must be less than or equal to the end date of the geographical area.\n\nGA4\nThe referenced parent geographical area group must be an existing geographical area with area code = 1 (geographical area group).\n\nGA5\nIf a geographical area has a parent geographical area group then the validity period of the parent geographical area group must span the validity period of the geographical area.\n\nRelationship with measures\n\n\nGA6\nLoops in the parent relation between geographical areas and parent geographical area groups are not allowed. If a geographical area A is a parent geographical area group of B then B cannot be a parent geographical area group of A (loops can also exist on more than two levels, e.g. level 3; If A is a parent of B and B is a parent of C then C cannot be a parent of A).\n\nGA7\nThe validity period of geographical area must not overlap any other geographical area with the same geographical area id.\n\nGA10\nWhen a geographical area is referenced in a measure then the validity period of the geographical area must span the validity period of the measure.\n\nGA11\nIf a geographical area is referenced as an excluded geographical area in a measure then the membership period of the (excluded) geographical area must span the validity period of the measure.\n\nRelation with geographical area membership\n\n\nGA12\nThe referenced geographical area id (member) must exist.\n\nGA13\nThe referenced geographical area id (member) can only be linked to a country or region (area code = 0 or 2).\n\nGA14\nThe referenced geographical area group id must exist.\n\nGA15\nThe membership start date must be less than or equal to the membership end date.\n\nGA16\nThe validity period of the geographical area group must span all membership periods of its members.\n\nGA17\nThe membership period of a geographical area (member) must be within (inclusive) the validity period of the geographical area group (geographical area’s start and end date).\n\nGA18\nWhen a geographical area is more than once member of the same group then there may be no overlap in their membership periods.\n\nGA19\nIf the associated geographical area group has a parent geographical area group then all the members of the geographical area group must also be members of the parent geographical area group.\n\nGA20\nIf the associated geographical area group has a parent geographical area group then the membership period of each member of the parent group must span the membership period of the same geographical area in the geographical area group.\n\nDelete a geographical area\n\n\nGA21\nIf a geographical area is referenced in a measure then it may not be deleted.\n\nGA22\nA geographical area cannot be deleted if it is referenced as a parent geographical area group.\n\nDelete a geographical area membership\n\n\nGA23\nIf a geographical area is referenced as an excluded geographical area in a measure, the membership association with the measure geographical area group cannot be deleted.\n\n        \n      ","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-data-structures/geographical-areas.html"},"24":{"title":"Measure conditions","content":"Measure conditions\n\n\nIntroduction to measure conditions\n\n\n\n\nAnatomy of a condition\n\n\nConditions -

The table below identifies the condition codes that are currently in use (12.01.20) in the EU Tariff. This is not all possible condition codes – there are a number that have been used in the past that are no longer in use. The highlighted rows are those that are in use most frequently, and, importantly are likely to be used most frequently in the UK tariff.\n\nMeasure conditions and condition components\n\n\nGoing back to the list of condition codes, there are a number of condition codes which make reference to a minimum or maximum import price, otherwise known as a reference price (or trigger price). These are highlighted in blue above.\nThe most frequent \u0026 volatile example of this in the EU tariff is condition type V – this is used to manage the Entry Price System (detailed later).\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, and the other condition codes that follow the same pattern, the fields in the measure condition code table (that start condition_) represent the trigger price: the fields in the measure_condition_components table represent the duties that will be payable a a result of the trigger condition having been met.\nExample overleaf …\n\nConditions and condition components – cherry tomatoesIf there is a complex mechanism to be demonstrated, it is a fair bet that it can be highlighted using cherry tomatoes, which attract most complexities - tomatoes plus another c. 30 commodities are subject (in the EU) to the Entry Price System.\n\nIn the diagram above (taken from the Trade Tariff Service), the measure condition trigger fields are highlighted in the red marquee.\nThe payable duty amounts are highlighted in blue – if the trigger condition is met (in this case if a consignment of tomatoes comes into the country at a price lower than or equal to a given threshold (trigger price), then the duty charged will be increased.\nBoiling it down, there are only really 2 condition mechanics\n        \n          \nDoes the trader have the right documentation?\n\n\nA\nPresentation   of an anti-dumping/countervailing document\n\nB\nPresentation   of a certificate/licence/document\n\nC\nPresentation   of a certificate/licence/document\n\nH\nPresentation   of a certificate/licence/document\n\nQ\nPresentation   of an endorsed certificate/licence\n\nY\nOther   conditions\n\nZ\nPresentation   of more than one certificate\n\n        \n      \n        \n          \nIs the price higher than a reference price?\n\n\nE\nThe   quantity or the price per unit declared, as appropriate, is equal or less   than the specified maximum, or presentation of the required document\n\nI\nThe   quantity or the price per unit declared, as appropriate, is equal or less   than the specified maximum, or presentation of the required document\n\nF\nThe   net free at frontier price before duty must be equal to or greater than the   minimum price (see components)\n\nL\nCIF   price must be higher than the minimum price (see components)\n\nM\nDeclared   price must be equal to or greater than the minimum price/reference price (see   components)\n\nR\nRatio   “net weight/supplementary unit” is equal to or higher than the   condition amount\n\nU\nRatio   “declared value/supplementary unit” should be higher than the   condition amount\n\nV\nImport   price must be equal to or greater than the entry price (see components)\n\n        \n      The different varieties of condition code are really just variations on two themes:\n\n\nis documentation right?\nis the price \u003e x?\n\nAction codes\n\nIf the condition code identifies the type of condition that has to be met, then the action code identifies the type of action that will be taken in response.\nThe table below lists the action codes that can be associated with a condition\nThe action code is mandatory – there is no value in a condition if there is no action to be taken on the back of it.\nThe list below is initially daunting – it is simplified when one observes that most action codes have a positive/negative variant: most action codes come in pairs\n\n\n        \n          \nID\nDescription\n\n01\nApply the amount of the action (see components)\n\n02\nApply the difference between the amount of the action (see components) and the price at import\n\n03\nApply the difference between the amount of the action (see components) and CIF price\n\n04\nThe entry into free circulation is not allowed\n\n05\nExport is not allowed\n\n06\nImport is not allowed\n\n07\nMeasure not applicable\n\n08\nDeclared subheading not allowed\n\n09\nImport/export not allowed after control\n\n10\nDeclaration to be corrected -

The smaller of the two is usually the negative action and the larger is the complementary positive action (e.g. x is not allowed vs x is allowed).\nThe following pairs of action codes always go together:\n\n        \n          \nPair\nDescription\n\n04   is paired with 24\nThe   entry into free circulation is not allowed / Entry into free circulation   allowed\n\n05   is paired with 25\nExport   is not allowed / Export allowed\n\n06   is paired with 26\nImport   is not allowed / Import is allowed\n\n07   is paired with 27\nMeasure   not applicable / Apply the mentioned duty\n\n08   is paired with 28\nDeclared   subheading not allowed / Declared subheading allowed\n\n09   is paired with 29\nImport   / export not allowed after control / Import/export allowed after control\n\n14   is paired with 34\nThe   exemption / reduction of the anti-dumping duty is not applicable / Apply   exemption / reduction of the anti-dumping duty\n\n16   is paired with 36\nExport   refund not applicable / Apply export refund\n\n        \n      Example of a pos / neg dual action code\n\nThese codes are typically used for restrictions that require some sort of documentation (certificate or license), although they may be used in all kids of circumstance (e.g. setting tiered duties for Trade Remedies).\nHere is an example on the UK Trade Tariff Service of a pair of conditions with pos / neg action codes – the positive being condition 1, the negative condition 2.\n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nCondition 1\nCondition 2\n\nmeasure_condition_sid\n1248652\n1248653\n\nmeasure_sid\n3604666\n3604666\n\ncondition_code\nB\nB\n\ncomponent_sequence_number\n1\n2\n\ncondition_duty_amount\nnull\nnull\n\ncondition_monetary_unit_code\nnull\nnull\n\ncondition_measurement_unit_code\nnull\nnull\n\ncondition_measurement_unit_qualifier_code\nnull\nnull\n\naction_code\n27\n7\n\ncertificate_type_code\nY\nnull\n\ncertificate_code\n085\nnull\n\n        \n      \n\nCondition code B means “Presentation of a certificate/licence/document” and is common to both conditions.\nThere is no trigger price (hence 4 * null fields across both conditions).\nAction codes are complementary (27 and 7) – the 27 is the positive and the 7 is the negative.\nThe certificate required to effect the positive action is Y085\n\nAND / OR logic for condition codes\n\nConditions are grouped together according to their condition code.\nWithin that group, the individual conditions are grouped together in an OR relationship, for example, in the conditions associated with the B condition code below, only one of the three noted goods needs to be provided, however it must be provided alongside one of the other conditions from block E being met (provision of a document or the weight of the imported good being below 2kg).\nIn this way, an additional tier is added to the logical condition model via the condition code grouping.\n\n\n\nVolumes of conditions\n\nDo not underestimate the complexity of measure conditions – there are up to 26 conditions on measures, as per the example here on commodity code 0308110000 (Aquatic invertebrates other than crustaceans and molluscs, live, fresh, chilled, frozen, dried, salted or in brine; smoked aquatic invertebrates other than crustaceans and molluscs, whether or not cooked before or during the smoking process; flours, meals and pellets of aquatic invertebrates other than crustaceans and molluscs, fit for human consumption)against the EU (measure_sid 3566626)\nIn this case, the conditions are aligned against 2 condition codes:\n\n\nwithin condition code B and E respectively, any of the positive conditions will result in an acceptance of the trade.\nat least one condition needs to be fulfilled within each of the two condition code groups.\n\nThe intellectual knowledge of certification is a huge challenge in DIT, Defra and HMG as a whole - over the implementation period, significant effort in DIT and Defra should be expended in looking to understand certification.\n\n\nDetailed overview of condition codesCondition code A\n\n\nThis condition code is used to modify the circumstances of an anti-dumping or anti-subsidy duty depending on the conditions stated.\nThere are three scenarios in which this condition code is used, two of which have 2 related (and opposite action codes)\n\n\nScenario 1 – apply conditional duties depending on supply of document\nScenario 2 – determine if the trade can go ahead\nScenario 3 - determining applicability of exemption/reduction of the anti-dumping duty\n\n\nScenario 1 – apply conditional duties depending on supply of document\n\n\nThis is by far the most common application of conditional duties for trade remedy-related measures\nThe applicable duty can be conditional on the supply of a document: if the document is supplied then the duty is reduced\nThis scenario is executed by:\n\n\nsetting multiple (usually two) measure conditions with condition code A\nthen assigning action code 01, which states ”Apply the amount of the action”\nand to each condition then assigning an applicable duty\n\nThe documents used in the EU, presumably to be followed in the UK are as follows:\n\n\nD005 - Commercial invoice within the framework of undertakings\nD008 - Invoice with a signed declaration\nD017 - Commercial invoice within the framework of undertakings and Export Undertaking Certificate\nD018 - Invoice for transactions which are not exempted from countervailing/anti-dumping duties\n\n\nScenario 2 – determine if the trade can go ahead at all\n\n\nFeatures a pair of action codes which are always supplied together and are opposites of each other\n\n\n08 - Declared subheading not allowed\nThe trade will be rejected in CDS\nThis is always associated with no document being specified, therefore not presented with the trade\n28 - Declared subheading allowed\nThis is always associated with a document being specified, therefore presented with the trade and hence, the trade being permitted\n\nThere is only one certificate that has been used in conjunction with this condition code / action code permutation\n\n\nD020 - Commercial invoice and mill certificate as defined in Regulation 2015/1953\n\nThis scenario is not currently in use, but it has been used in the past\n\nScenario 3 – determining applicability of exemption/reduction of the anti-dumping duty\n\n\nAs with scenario 2, this features a pair of conditions with complementing action codes that are always found together\nThough not completely defunct, this is used only three times in current measures by the EU\nThe two action codes are:\n\n\n34 - Apply exemption/reduction of the anti-dumping duty\n14 - The exemption/reduction of the anti-dumping duty is not applicable\n\nThis basically means that the antidumping duty will be waived entirely or reduced according to the legislation. There are no conditional duties set however, therefore it is not 100% clear where the duty calculation will get its raw data from\nThe conditions should be applied in the sequence 34 then 14, i.e. positive followed by negative\nThere is only one current certificate in use that is used with this condition code / action code combination\n\n\nD008 - Invoice with a signed declaration\n\n\n\n\nConditions B, C and H are identical in meaning\nC and H are used when multiple condition sets using the same mechanic need to be applied to the same measure.\n\nCondition codes B, C \u0026 H\n\n\nCodes B, C and H require a certificate or other document to be presented in order for the requirement to be fulfilled.\nCondition codes C \u0026 H are identical to condition code B, and there is no overt reason as to why C / H might be used instead of B – they are however sometimes used alongside code B.\nCommodity code 8418690091 provides the answer as to why there are two types of condition that are ostensibly identical, i.e. there is a desire to apply multiple conditions sets to the same measure (in this case Import control of fluorinated greenhouse gases).\nIf just B had been used, it would not have been possible to apply the AND logic of the two condition groups.\nH is used only 41 times (Jan 2020); C is used c. 5,000 times whereas B is vastly more prevalent (c. 24,000 occurrences).\n\n\nCondition code E\n\n\nThis condition code is a combination of a quantitative restriction plus a documentation requirement, i.e. a trade will be allowed provided the volume of goods is lower than the defined threshold weight (or other unit), or a document is provided that permits the trade in a larger volume of goods.\nThe criteria that define these two conditions are set in the measure condition data.\n\n\nCondition code I\n\n\nThese condition codes are currently used uniquely with measure types 751 and 755 (import and export control of waste)\nThey are functionally identical to condition code E (see above).\nType I is only ever used in conjunction with type E to present a send condition set of the same type, never on its own\n\n\nCondition code F\n\n\nThese conditions allow duties to be charged against imported goods subject to Trade Remedies (Anti dumping or anti subsidy duties) that are dependent upon the unit price of the import.\nThis is significantly less commonly used than condition code A, which is also used to apply conditional logic to the trade of a good subject to an AD / AS duty, but remains an option for the TRA: there are 119 such conditions against 17,000 + of type A.\nIn the example below on measure 3571830 on commodity 2933610000 (melamine), there are two F-type conditions, which are dependent on the import price: the duties are set accordingly.\nWhat these conditions say is:\n\n\nif the goods is imported at a price of higher than €1153 per tonne, then apply zero additional punitive duty (condition 1)\nBUT if the import of the good is at a lower price, apply the difference between the import price and the punitive duty\n\nThis essentially sets a minimum import \n\n\nCondition code L\n\n\nThis is currently used only 30 times and is always applied to measures of type 652 - Additional duty based on cif price\nThis measure type is used in managing a complex agricultural duty called “Representative prices for chicken”, which in the EU tariff is applied to certain poultry products that are being traded from Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Thailand – the most aggressive of chicken traders.\nThe UK is not going to be taking on this policy, unless plans change between now and the end of 2020.\nThe policy is far too complex to describe here, but is described in detail in the general training manual.\n\nCondition code M\n\n\nCondition code M is used in two circumstances:\n\n\nThe first circumstance is the in managing EU supplied credibility checks of type:\n430 Control of particulars of the declaration (suspicious value/net weight or value/supplementary unit)\n483 Declaration of subheading submitted to restrictions (value)\n\nA credibility check is a mechanism that is employed in a border system to attempt to reduce errors in declarations by enforcing a check on (for example) the weight versus item count ratio of a declaration.\n430 and 483 are measures (along with 431) that are used by the EU to ensure that discrepancies are avoided.\nThe EU provides these across the whole of the EU because they are trying to ensure consistency and reduce errors (that they have to fix for all 28 member states).\nAfter EU Exit, the UK will provide its own credibility checks – the EU’s measures will be terminated\nIn reality, the EU’s credibility checks are a small subset of the overall number of checks that are carried out. CHIEF and CDS are replete with many UK-specific credibility checks as well. In the future, these will all be managed by HMRC, not by DIT MTPO, therefore are out of scope for DIT (albeit there is nothing to prevent TAP from creating these).\nThe second circumstance will continue after EU Exit, as it deals with Trade Remedies. The existing conditions of this type are against measure type ID 552 Definitive anti-dumping duty, but there is no reason why this would not also be assigned to measure types 551, 553 and 554.\nThis follows a similar pattern to other threshold-based commodities previously noted\nThere are currently (Jan 2020) 84 instances of condition code M.\nIn the examples below, there are two conditions which behave more or less the same as condition type F, where the applicable punitive duty is dependent the declared price [F depends on net free at frontier price before duty].\n\n\nCondition code Q\n\n\nCondition type Q is used in all cases where a measure is put in place to represent a licensed quota. And in all cases it refers to the single license Y100 (Special entries on the import licence AGRIM). It is used in measures of type:\n\n\n122  Non preferential tariff quota\n123  Non preferential tariff quota under end-use\n142  Tariff preference\n143  Preferential tariff quota\n\nIt is only used for licensed quotas; it is never used for FCFS quotas.\n\n\nCondition code R\n\n\nAs per scenario 1 for condition code M, this is used to apply conditions to credibility checks to ensure that the weight ‘looks right’ against the number of declared goods. The supplementary unit identifies what additional unit beyond the KGM weight must be supplied by the trader on declaring their import.\nAgain, as per condition code M, the UK will be abandoning the practise of managing credibility checks in the Taric file after EU Exit.\n\nCondition code U\n\n\nAs per scenario 1 for condition codes M \u0026 R, this is used to apply conditions to credibility checks to ensure that the declared value ‘looks right’ against the number of declared goods.\nThe supplementary unit identifies what additional unit beyond the KGM weight must be supplied by the trader on declaring their import.\nAs per condition codes M \u0026 R, the UK will be abandoning the practise of managing credibility checks in the Taric file after EU Exit.\n\nCondition code V – The Entry price System\n\n\nThe Entry Price System (EPS) is a complex mechanism to apply tiered duties to 31 agricultural products, primarily fruit.\nThe EPS is described in detail elsewhere, so this page will not go into that much detail, especially as the UK will be abandoning the Entry Price System. It supports growers of (primarily) citrus fruits in Southern Europe: the UK’s less sunny climes do not lend themselves to industrial-scale citriculture.\n\n\n\n\nThe screen above is captured from the third country duty for cherry tomatoes – this shows the EPS in action.\nThe duties that are applicable depend on the import price: the cheaper the import, the more expensive the duty\nThe purpose of this is to protect domestic growers in s. Europe from influxes of very cheap goods.\n\n\nIn the example above, each row is a price threshold: if the import price falls below a given threshold, then the duty from the row below is charged.\nThe data for EPS-related measures is as per the example to the below – just one row (marquee below).\n\nThis is, as its name suggests a catch all that can be used to manage effectively any condition not specifically covered by the other condition codes. In practice, this seems to have been used in the past by the EU for managing certificates, much in the vein of conditions with code B, C or H. But the real reason for using this is for non-specific conditions that are not associated with a specific document.\nThese miscellaneous conditions are linked to in much the same way that certificates are referenced, using the certificate type code and certificate code fields. Here are a few examples of conditions that are referenced by condition code Y. None of these are documents per se: they reference properties of goods or activities undertaken by traders outside of the core declaration flow.\nFor example:\n* Y019  Request for preferential treatment for Iceland\n* Y021  Request for EEA preferential treatment\n* Y034  Derogation from export prohibition by virtue of Article 4.1 of Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1509\n* Y037  Goods exempted from the prohibition – biathlon equipment\nNone of the conditions linked to via the condition code ‘Y’ utilise the price threshold fields.\nCondition code Z\n\nCondition code Z is used solely on national P \u0026 R measures currently, though it is by no means a stipulation that this has to be so. Indeed, all the national P \u0026 R will become homogenised with the measures inherited from the EU after EU Exit – though the management of measures to support the NI Protocol may influence the specific approach.\nThese are the measure types where Z is used:\n\n\nATT   Attestation Document (horticulture and potatoes)\nCEX   DCMS Open General Export Licence\nCOE   Home Office Controlled Drugs (export)\nCOI   HMI Conformity Certificate (fruit and veg) issued in UK\nEQC   Certificate of Conformity\nHOP   Home Office pre-cursor chemical authorisation\nPRE   Home Office Pre-cursor chemicals\nPRT   Home Office Controlled Drugs (import)\n\nThere is no reason why this condition code should be used in preference to B, C or H. Indeed there are occasions where the Z type is used, but only one positive condition is included, which seems to make the condition type pretty redundant (e.g. with EQC measures).\nThe advice to tariff managers would be to always use condition code B, then C then H before resorting to Z.\nKey business processing rules\n        \n          \n#\nRule\nNotes\n\nME53\nThe referenced measure condition must exist.\nRequired   This applies when assigning conditions components to   conditions A measure obvs has to be in existence too for a measure condition   to be generated in the first place.\n\nME54\nThe validity period of the referenced measure condition   must span the validity period of the measure.\nNot required - disregard   As far as we can see, this is an erroneous business rule:   the measure condition table does not have a start and end date field. The   condition adopts the start and end dates of the parent measure. Similarly,   there are no start and end dates associated with a measure condition   component (or for that matter a measure component). They all adopt the date   constraints of the parent measure.\n\nME55\nA measure condition refers to a measure condition or to a condition   + certificate or to a condition + amount specifications.\nDisregard   This has been written so vaguely that there are no rules   to be gleaned from it\n\nME56\nThe referenced certificate must exist.\nRequired   A certificate must exist before being assigned to a   condition – match must be made on the 2 clustered primary key fields of   certificate type code and certificate code\n\nME57\nThe validity period of the referenced certificate must   span the validity period of the measure.\nRequired   The optimal way for us to handle this is to NEVER expire   certificates – there is literally no need. However the validity start dates   and end dates of the measure and the certificate need to be checked. See note   at the foot of this document as to how null end dates have been dealt with in   terms of comparing extents – to reduce code\n\nME58\nThe same certificate can only be referenced once by the   same measure and the same condition type.\nRequired   There should never be a requirement to apply a certificate   more than once, but it needs to be checked. Again – use the 2 pronged cluster   primary key.\n\nME59\nThe referenced action code must exist.\nDebatable   The measure action table should remain fixed – by making   any modifications to this table, we are creating a lot of work for downstream   systems which need to be adjusted to cater for the change (CDS, Gems,   Caesar).\n\nME60\nThe referenced monetary unit must exist.\nRequired    Conditions are put in place to respond either to the   provision of some sort of document / license or to respond to a minimum   threshold import price – if the latter then there is a requirement to specify   a valid monetary unit, which is always likely to be GBP.\n\nME61\nThe validity period of the referenced monetary unit must   span the validity period of the measure.\nRequired - debatable   The unit will always be GBP or EUR – all we need to do is   to ensure that the units are not end-dated\n\nME61\nThe validity period of the referenced monetary unit must   span the validity period of the measure.\nRequired - debatable   The unit will always be GBP or EUR – all we need to do   is to ensure that the units are not end-dated\n\nME62\nThe combination measurement unit + measurement unit   qualifier must exist.\nRequired   The relationship between a measurement_unit and any   qualifer that can be used against that measurement unit is defined in the   table “measurements” – this needs to be observed fully or CDS will generate   an error. Measurements have start and end dates against them, and these also   need to be observed.\n\nME63\nThe validity period of the measurement unit must span the   validity period of the measure.\nRequired   Measurement units have start dates end dates – we need   to observe these start and end dates in the creation of measures. We are not   offering a tool to manage measurement units in the first instance.\n\nME64\nThe validity period of the measurement unit qualifier must   span the validity period of the measure.\nRequired   Measurement unit qualifiers have start dates end dates   – we need to observe these start and end dates in the creation of measures.   We are not offering a tool to manage qualifiers in the first instance.\n\nME105\nThe referenced duty expression must exist.\nRequired   There is a specified list of duty expressions that can   be used in TAP / CDS. We must not use any duty expressions that are not   valid.\n\nME106\nThe VP of the duty expression must span the VP of the   measure.\nRequired   There are a number of duty expressions that are no   longer valid – they have been end dated (in 1996 and 2016 primarily). We must   not use these.\n\nME108\nThe same duty expression can only be used once within   condition components of the same condition of the same measure. (i.e. it can   be re-used in other conditions, no matter what condition type, of the same   measure)\nRequired   Even if an expression that (in English) reads the same   needs to be used more than once in a measure, we must use a different   expression ID, never the same one twice.\n\nME109\nIf the flag ‘amount’ on duty expression is ‘mandatory’   then an amount must be specified. If the flag is set to ‘not permitted’ then   no amount may be entered.\nRequired   The three possible values for this field on the   duty_expressions table are:   0 - Permitted   1 - Mandatory   2 - Not permitted   These values must be observed – By the way, we should   not allows users to modify the data associated with duty expressions, as the   knock on impact will be too significant.\n\nME110\nIf the flag ‘monetary unit’ on duty expression is   ‘mandatory’ then a monetary unit must be specified. If the flag is set to   ‘not permitted’ then no monetary unit may be entered.\nRequired   The three possible values for this field on the   duty_expressions table are:   0 - Permitted   1 - Mandatory   2 - Not permitted   These values must be observed – As above, we should not   allows users to modify the data associated with duty expressions.\n\nME111\nIf the flag ‘measurement unit’ on duty expression is   ‘mandatory’ then a measurement unit must be specified. If the flag is set to   ‘not permitted’ then no measurement unit may be entered.\nRequired   The three possible values for this field on the   duty_expressions table are:   0 - Permitted   1 - Mandatory   2 - Not permitted   These values must be observed – As above, we should not   allows users to modify the data associated with duty expressions.\n\n        \n      \n","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-data-structures/measure-conditions.html"},"25":{"title":"Nomenclature","content":"Commodity codes\n\n\nThe Combined Nomenclature and the Harmonised System\n\n\nSections\n\n\n\n\nConcepts and terminology\n\n\nCommodity codes\n\n\nProduct line suffixes\n\n\nIndents\n\n\nIn practice\n\n\nChapters 98 and 99\n\n\n\n\nDeclarability and measure assignment\n\n\nJams and jellies are very complex\n\n\nSmashing preconceptions on hierarchical inheritance\n\n\n\n\nOrigins\n\n\nSuccessors\n\n\nResidual codes\n\n\n\n\nUser needs\n\n\nKey business rules\n\n\n\n\nCommodity codes are 10-digit codes that refer to specific products, traders must put these codes on their declaration forms when importing or exporting goods.\nNomenclature, also known as goods classification, goods nomenclature or commodity code classification, is the name for the full list of products in the UK Tariff.\n\nThe Combined Nomenclature and the Harmonised System\nHS - Harmonised System\n\n\nThe first six digits of the code numbers of the tariff or TARIC have been regulated by the World Customs Organization (WCO) in the form of the HS nomenclature world-wide since 1988.\nHS is currently used in 176 countries.

Next change anticipated in 2022.\n\n\nCN - Combined Nomenclature\n\n\nThe “Combined Nomenclature” is published in the Official Journal of the European Community in October each year and specifies the first eight digits of the Tariff/Taric, as well as third country tariff rates for the following year. This eight-digit nomenclature can not be changed over a period of one year and applies both in the EU and the Associated States (BG, RO, TR, etc.).\n\n\nTARIC - Tarif Intégré Communautaire / Tarif intégré des Communautés européennes\n\n\nTaric, the tariff rate of the European Communities, is the same as the CN in the first eight digits.

The Taric is subdivided however by the Taric sub-positions (from the ninth place) more deeply.\nAs the combined nomenclature is not sufficiently detailed to support the community tariff and commercial legislation, the 8-digit codes can be broken down into 10-digit codes called “TARIC codes”. \nThese codes are created at any time, according to the legislative needs.\n\n\nSections\n\nThe Harmonised System is categorised into sections and chapters\nThe section is a logical grouping that is not reflected in the nomenclature.\nEach chapter, which is a subdivision of a section, is fully self-contained within the logical section.\nSections are represented by Roman numerals (1 to 21 / I to XXI)\n\n\n\n        \n          \nChapter\nDescription\n\nI\nLive   animals; animal products (chapter 1 - 5)\n\nII\nVegetable   products (chapter 6 - 14)\n\nIII\nAnimal   or vegetable fats and oils and their cleavage products; prepared edible fats;   animal or vegetable waxes (chapter 15)\n\nIV\nPrepared   foodstuffs; beverages, spirits and vinegar; tobacco and manufactured tobacco   substitutes (chapter 16 - 24)\n\nV\nMineral   products (chapter 25 - 27)\n\nVI\nProducts   of the chemical or allied industries (chapter 28 - 38)\n\nVII\nPlastics   and articles thereof; rubber and articles thereof (chapter 39 - 40)\n\nVIII\nRaw   hides and skins, leather, furskins and articles thereof; saddlery and   harness; travel goods, handbags and similar containers; articles of animal   gut (other than silkworm gut) (chapter 41 - 43)\n\nIX\nWood   and articles of wood; wood charcoal; cork and articles of cork; manufactures   of straw, of esparto or of other plaiting materials; basketware and   wickerwork (chapter 44 - 46)\n\nX\nPulp   of wood or of other fibrous cellulosic material; recovered (waste and scrap)   paper or paperboard; paper and paperboard and articles thereof (chapter   (chapter 47 - 49)\n\nXI\nTextiles   and textile articles (chapter 50 - 63)\n\nXII\nFootwear,   headgear, umbrellas, sun umbrellas, walking-sticks, seat-sticks, whips,   riding-crops and parts thereof; prepared feathers and articles made   therewith; artificial flowers; articles of human hair (chapter 64 - 67)\n\nXIII\nArticles   of stone, plaster, cement, asbestos, mica or similar materials; ceramic   products; glass and glassware (chapter 68 - 70)\n\nXIV\nNatural   or cultured pearls, precious or semi-precious stones, precious metals, metals   clad with precious metal and articles thereof; imitation jewellery; coins   (chapter 71)\n\nXV\nBase   metals and articles of base metal (chapter 72 - 83)\n\nXVI\nMachinery   and mechanical appliances; electrical equipment; parts thereof, sound   recorders and reproducers, television image and sound recorders and   reproducers, and parts and accessories of such articles (chapter 84 - 85)\n\nXVII\nVehicles,   aircraft, vessels and associated transport equipment (chapter 86 - 89)\n\nXVIII\nOptical,   photographic, cinematographic, measuring, checking, precision, medical or   surgical instruments and apparatus; clocks and watches; musical instruments;   parts and accessories thereof (chapter 90 - 92)\n\nXIX\nArms   and ammunition; parts and accessories thereof (chapter 93)\n\nXX\nMiscellaneous   manufactured articles (chapter 94 - 96)\n\nXXI\nWorks   of art, collectors’ pieces and antiques (chapter 97 - 99)\n\n        \n      Concepts and terminology\n\nThe UK refers to the full list of products in the UK Tariff as the Goods Classification – this is synonymous with the broad name for the full list of products: goods nomenclature or just nomenclature.\nIn the EU, this is referred to under multiple names: often the EU refers to the Tariff as the “Combined Nomenclature” (CN), though officially this refers only to the first 8 digits of the code.\nWithin the broader body, the individual elements referring to specific products are called commodity codes.\nThe commodity code is what is entered into the SAD (C88) form – the Single Administrative Document that acts as the import declaration form – see ringed box below.\nThere is a total of 24,504 commodity codes (as of 1st December 2019): of these 15,887 are declarable end-lines (see definition later).\n\n\nThere are three key concepts to understand in this section. All of these have a significant impact on the measures that can be defined and managed by Tariff Managers:\n\n\ncommodity codes\nproduct line suffixes\nindents\n\nCommodity codesThese are the 10-digit codes that traders put on their declaration forms when importing or exporting goods.\nCommodity codes are often shown with fewer than 10 characters to represent higher levels of the classification hierarchy – in these cases, the missing digits are always zeroes. For example, HS4 code “0102” really represents the 10-digit code “0102000000”. Any spaces or dots added to commodity codes are for presentation purposes only.\nProduct line suffixesThe product line suffix is a device introduced by the WCO and adopted by the EU and UK to be able to add order and structure to the goods hierarchy. A value of “80” means that the good represents a commodity code that in theory could be declared and exists in legislation.\nA value of less than 80 (e.g. “10”, “20”, “30”, etc) means that the commodity code is only present for grouping and structure purposes. Measures can only be attached to codes with a suffix of 80.\nIndentsThe tariff originated primarily as a printed document. The indent was used to identify how many centimetres the heading was to be indented on the page. This gives a good indication as to how deep the commodity code is in the hierarchy but unfortunately there are several issues that prevent it from representing the depth exactly.\nIn practice\n\nThe schematic below illustrates a ‘hierarchy’ starting from the very first commodity code in the Tariff (0100 00 00 00) down to the last end-line under the 1st major HS heading branch (0101 90 00 00), i.e. Live horses, asses, mules and hinnies\nThis shows the commodity codes, split into segments for ease of reading, the product line suffix and the indent, as well as the current description of the commodity code.\nThe physical indent on the description matches the indent field.\nHence, Horses is a ‘child’ of ‘Live horses, asses, mules and hinnies’ and ‘Pure-bred breeding animals’ is a child of ‘Horses’ – however these relationships are inferred, not explicit.\nYou will notice that there are two zeroes at the start of the tree – this is a slightly bewildering treatment from the EU, but we need to work with it: the HS chapter and the HS heading both use an indent of 0. This will not be of huge immediate interest, as these codes will not change until the lead-up to January 2022.\nNote that in some chapters (e.g. 29) there are three levels of 0-indent headings. This is because there are additional grouping headings in the legislation with Roman numerals and these are represented in the tariff at zero indent and with a suffix of 10.\n\n\nIf one were to try and print out the whole commodity tree (c. 24,500 lines), you would:\n\n\nselect the commodity codes with current validity\nsort them by commodity code and then product line suffix\nindent them using the indent field\n\nChapters 98 and 99Chapters 98 and 99 are part of the EU’s special coding system and are not defined by the WCO Harmonised System.\nChapter 98 is for statistical reporting purposes for industrial plant and is never declared directly by traders – no codes in this chapter have measures so it would be impossible to declare on it.\nChapter 99 contains codes for certain specific movements of goods, such as personal effects belonging to a person moving house. Chapter 99 was optional for Member States under the EU customs code and the UK did not legislate for its use, so it is currently not available for declarations but remains in the dataset. It’s also worth noting that chapter 99, despite having extra subheadings like chapter 29, doesn’t have three levels of zero indent.\nDeclarability and measure assignment\n\nA SAD form requires that the trader enter the most detailed description possible for the good that is being traded, not something vague like ‘Horses’\nThere are two rules that define whether or not a good is declarable, i.e. whether or not it can be entered onto a SAD form:\nfirst, a good must have a product line suffix (PLS) of “80”: anything else cannot be traded – these commodity codes are in the database purely as structural fillers\nsecond, a good must be an end-line aka a leaf. i.e. it must not have any children.\nIn the example below, the declarable commodities are those with a D against them\nAlthough 0101 29 00 00, 01010 00 00 00 and 0101 00 00 00 all have a PLS of “80”, they all have child codes underneath them, therefore cannot be declared.\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above (red marquee), it is interesting to note (and this is key in understanding where a product line suffix other than “80” is used), that there are two items with the commodity code 0101 21 00 00.\nOne has a PLS of 10, the other has a PLS of 80.\nThis is common and is likely to be a treatment we need to get used to in the UK for future change.\n\nJams and jellies are very complex\n\n\nThe image above shows the complexity of certain hierarchies.\nThe indent numbers have been doctored slightly to show the true number of indents, ignoring the double zero noted previously.\nThere are actually 14 tiers of data in certain points in the hierarchy, as shown here\nThis is exceptional however\nPlease also note the apparently inconsistent use of product line suffixes: why has 2007 99 39 00 got a PLS of “80” when it is clearly an intermediate code?\nThe answer seems to be that the non-80 code is used where there is a need to insert a structural heading with the same commodity code as the subsequent code, presumably due to space restrictions in the hierarchy.\n\nSmashing preconceptions on hierarchical inheritance\n\n\nThis is undoubtedly an unusually complex tree, however it does illustrate well a concept that needs to be understood, to help the Tariff management team to grasp the idea of inheritance, which is critical in measure management.\nThe 10-digit commodity code is divided into 5 pairs of digits.\nWhile it is alluring to consider that these two digit pairs provide enough information to work out the hierarchy, this is coincidental, though, certainly at the top of the hierarchy, frequently true.\n\nThere are five main reasons why new commodities are required\nNew commodities - examples\n\nDo not underestimate WCO changes\n\n\n\nThe graph above shows the peaks and troughs of nomenclature management over the last 10 years\nThe 2 big peaks are on 1st Jan 2012 and 1st Jan 2017, the to dates in the last 10 years where the WCO has made alterations to their HS6 structures.\nEvery non-WCO year follows a similar peak / trough structure\nBig peak in Jan (annual CN code changes, smaller peak in July (new suspension), ad hoc for the rest of the year\n2019 has been an outlier, as commodity code changes have taken place throughout the year\n\nJanuary 2022 will require a lot of preparation\n\nWCO 5-year changes are significant\n\n\n\nThis shows the change from 31st December to 2nd January on just a small branch 0305 59 00\nMost of these changes were deletions, not creations.\nThe spike of 2,334 was more like 4,500 actual changes\n\nWCO HS correlation tables\n\n\n\nHere is a page from a 60-page correlation table document, comparing the HS systems of 2012 and 2017\nThe WCO specify the changes that are made to the 4 and 6 digit codes that they master.\nBut … the majority of the change is felt lower down the hierarchy.\nYou move a parent, you have to move the children.\nAnd in moving a child, you have to give it a new commodity code, due to the need to sequence by comm code and pls.\nThis really means ending an old comm code and creating a new \n\nThere are two additional concepts that are useful to know, but play a far smaller part in the management of goods classification. “Origins and successors” are intended to create an audit trail when commodity codes change.\nOrigins\n\nAn origin defines the commodity code from which a new commodity code was derived.\nWhen a commodity code is split into two, the ‘origin’ of the two (or more) new commodity codes is the parent commodity code.\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, a successor will have been created for codes 2001 90 70 10 and 2001 90 70 90 of2001 90 70 00.\nIt is mandatory that at least one origin is created for every new commodity code\nHowever, this data is of zero value to the Tariff Application\n\nSuccessors\n\nAn successor defines the commodity code into which an existing commodity code has been absorbed.\nIt is not mandatory for a successor code to be created, though they may be created.\n\nResidual codes\n\nThe sweet peppers example can also be used to exemplify residual codes.\nA residual code is the code usually labelled ’Other’ which is created when a code is split into a specific and remainder part.\nIn this example 2001 90 70 00 is split into 2 child codes.\n\n\nThe specific code is assigned 10 as the final 2 digits.\nThe residual code is assigned 90 as the final 2 digits.\nIf in future more child codes as added to the parent as siblings to 10 and 90, then these are assigned 20, 30, 40 etc as the final 2 digits, while space remains.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a code is split on the last digit, rather than the last 2 digits, it is usually split into 1 and 9, for example:\n\n\n\n\nThere are more than 6,500 residual codes in the database \n\nUser needs\n        \n          \nAs a …\nI   want to …\nSo   that …\nNotes\n\nUK Tariff Manager\nbrowse through the commodity code hierarchy to find   commodity codes\nI can locate a

Most elements use a pair of validity dates: the element is live after the validity start date and before the validity end date.\nIf the validity end date is blank then the element is live indefinitely. Validity dates can be modified after the initial creation of an element, so an element that initially has a blank end date can be updated to subsequently add one.\nStart and end validity dates are inclusive – meaning that the element is live from the beginning of the start date to the end of the end date. An element with the same start and end date is therefore live for 1 day.\nValidity dates on descriptionsDescription elements have a requirement that there must always be one live description at any time. For this reason, descriptions do not have end dates and only have start dates. The description is live up until the start date of the next description record.\nValidity date of measuresThere are four ways in which measures can get end dated:\n\n\nWhere the measure is given an explicit end date on the measure record itself\nWhere the measure’s generating regulation is a base regulation, and the base regulation is end-dated\nWhere the measure’s generating regulation is a modification regulation, and the modification regulation is end-dated\nWhere the measure’s generating regulation is a modification regulation, and the base regulation that it modifies is end-dated\n\nNumbers 2–4 also have to take account of the “effective end date” which if set should be used over any explicit date. The effective end date is set when other types of regulations are used (abrogation, prorogation, etc).\nIn the UK tariff, we will not be using regulation end dates and will only ever stop measures by adding end dates explicitly.\n","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-data-structures/validity-dates.html"},"27":{"title":"Tariff policy","content":"Tariff policy","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-policy.html"},"28":{"title":"Tariff data idioms","content":"Tariff data idiomsThese set of pages go into detail about how the high-level tariff concepts are constructed from low-level components.\n","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-data-idioms.html"},"29":{"title":"Trade remedies","content":"Trade remedies\n\n\nIntroduction to Trade Remedies\n\n\nAnti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties\n\n\nSafeguard duties\n\n\nRelationship with the DDaT / TRA Trade Remedies Case Mgmt System\n\n\nAnti-dumping \u0026 anti-subsidy duties\n\n\n\n\nTrade Remedies cases\n\n\nInitiating cases\n\n\nInvestigation methodology\n\n\nDetermining measures\n\n\nConcluding Trade Remedy Investigations\n\n\nUndertakings\n\n\nReviewing cases\n\n\nMonitoring cases\n\n\nMigrating cases\n\n\nAnti-dumping processes\n\n\nTrade remedy measures - overview\n\n\nMeasure types\n\n\n\n\nDeclaration of subheading submitted to authorised use provisions (464)\n\n\nProvisional anti-dumping duty (551)\n\n\nDefinitive anti-dumping duty (552)\n\n\nProvisional countervailing duty (553)\n\n\nDefinitive countervailing duty (554)\n\n\nAnti-dumping / Countervailing duty - Pending collection (555)\n\n\nNotice of initiation of an anti-dumping or countervailing proceeding (561)\n\n\nSuspended anti-dumping or countervailing duty (562)\n\n\nAnti-dumping or countervailing registration (564)\n\n\nAnti-dumping/countervailing review (565)\n\n\nChanges to measure type description\n\n\nIntroduction to Trade Remedies\n\nTrade Remedy is the name given to defensive trade instruments that can be used to protect domestic industry against illicit trade activity by overseas nations or companies, or to protect against a sudden an unexpected glut of goods entering the market.\nTrade Remedies come in three flavours:\nAnti-dumping duties\nAnti-subsidy duties (aka countervailing duties)\nSafeguards\nSafeguards have some similarity to the agricultural safeguards (e.g. representative prices for chicken, the Entry Price System), in that they are not put in place to punish illicit behaviour, rather to act as a pressure valve, should international market flows suddenly change and, thus, threaten domestic industry.\n\nAnti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties\n\nAnti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties are quite similar, therefore should be dealt with together. Both are put in place to protect domestic industry against uncompetitive behaviour by overseas business.\nAnti-dumping duties may be applied when an overseas business is found guilty of ‘dumping’ its product on a foreign market at a price which is lower than it would have been sold on its own domestic market, and that dumping has been found to cause injury to suppliers in that overseas market, who could lose market share as a result.\nAnti-subsidy duties may be applied when an overseas is found to have gained an unfair advantage in international commerce through illegal state subsidies, which allow the company to market their goods at a distorted low price, again threatening the viability of international rivals.\nThe processes for managing through anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases are also very similar and will be dealt with together in this guide.\n\nSafeguard duties\n\nUntil 2018, safeguards were extremely rare. Then the current President of the United States set out on his protectionist approach to boosting US industry by applying punitive duties to goods coming into the country from abroad.\nWorld trade is a fine balance – any drastic change in activity (pricing, demand etc) from one significant party will affect the trade flows throughout the world – this happened with steel and related metal products from 2017 onwards, when USA whacked 25% duties on imports of steel from major exporters.\nThe net effect of this was that suppliers of steel, which previously had a fertile market in USA had to find alternative buyers. Europe became the next market, and the knock-on impact was to damage EU suppliers’ viability.\nTherefore the EU put in place, from early 2018 onwards, a set of safeguard measures to attempt to restore a pre-Trump balance of trade. These took the form of a combination of a 25% additional duty (to be charged over and above the MFN or any preference applied duty), which was then moderated by the application of quotas to certain goods that were made available to specific countries, such that the EU could take advantage of a given volume of ‘cheap’ imported products without wrecking businesses across the EU’s industrial heartlands.\nDo not confuse safeguards with retaliatory duties, which display many overt similarities – see separate guide.\n\nRelationship with the DDaT / TRA Trade Remedies Case Mgmt System\n\nDDaT has also constructed a dedicated case management application for use by the TRA in managing a Trade Remedy case from initiation to completion.\nWhile the subject matter is the same, there is no data link currently between this application and Tariffs.\nWhile at the end of the investigation, the TRA would construct a document containing recommended punitive tariff duties to be forwarded to the DIT Secretary of State for a yes / no decision, this is effectively offline: a document is constructed with a management summary, leading then to a public notice which is then posted on gov.uk.\nThe TRA will be expected to complete a pro-forma (essentially an Excel spreadsheet) describing to the MTPO team the duties they have agreed to impose\n\n\nAnti-dumping \u0026 anti-subsidy duties\nTrade Remedies casesTrade Remedies cases are rare, but when they happen, they are significant chunks of work, both for the investigating authority and, ultimately, for the Tariff Manager. As an average, in the EU, there are c. 10 new Trade Remedies cases investigated through to conclusion annually, which sounds small – but the impact on the tariff is drastic.\n\nThe TRA / TRID\n\n\nWhile we are a part of the EU, the UK has no authority or team to investigate anti-dumping / anti-subsidy complaints: all such activity is undertaken by the relevant Trade Defence organisation within the European Commission.\nWhen we leave, this trade defence role will be taken on by the Trade Remedies Authority (TRA). At the point of writing, the TRA has not been formally instituted: the intention had been to create an Arms’ Length Body, affiliated to but completely independent of the Department for International Trade. The legal vehicle through which the TRA was to be formed (The Trade Act) is yet to be passed, therefore the TRA exists in an intermediate state, still as part of DIT under the guise of the TRID (Trade Remedies Investigations Directorate) - the evolution into the TRA is expected in 2020.\nUntil the end of the Implementation period, which could be as early as Jan 1st 2021, the UK will remain as a part of the EU’s Common External Tariff and, as such, will not be able to impose its own punitive duties, however the ability to investigate cases starts on Feb 1st 2020 – we are going to begin by reviewing the duties imposed in the EU cases that we are retaining\n\nInitiating cases\n\nArticle 5 of the WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement and article 11 of the WTO Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Agreement state that investigations can only be initiated following a written application by or on behalf of the domestic industry.\nFor an investigation to proceed, the companies requesting that investigation must account for more than 25% of total domestic production of the product in question\nTheir output must also exceed that of domestic producers that expressly oppose an investigation.\nThey must also provide preliminary prima facie evidence of dumping, injury and causation.\nUnless these conditions are met the investigating authority cannot initiate a case, without being subject to the risk of a legal challenge by the exporter’s home country. There are no related provisions dictating how the initiation of safeguards investigations should work.\nHowever, trade remedy investigation authorities can initiate cases without this application (ex-officio initiations), in special circumstances but there must be sufficient evidence of dumping or a subsidy, evidence of injury, and a causal link between the two.\nEx-officio initiations are possible in the EU and most other comparable countries, with the exception of New Zealand.\nHowever, none of these countries have ‘self-initiated’ cases via their investigating authority except in exceptional circumstances.\n\nInvestigation methodology\n\nWhen an investigation is initiated, WTO Agreements set out the parameters for the investigation and the evidence that should be gathered. Within these parameters, the UK Government intends that the investigation methodology should be objective and transparent when: \n\n\nestablishing the level of dumping (in anti-dumping cases), \ndetermining the impacts of a subsidy (in anti-subsidy cases) \nidentifying unexpected surges of imports (in safeguards cases) should be objective and transparent \ndetermining injury (or serious injury in the case of safeguards), and the causal links.\n\n\nDetermining measures\nProvisional Measures\nProvisional measures enable countries to prevent injury being caused to a domestic industry while the latter stages of a trade remedies investigation is being carried out, subject to certain conditions, as follows:\n  * an investigation has been initiated and all parties have been given the opportunity to submit information and make comments,\n  * the preliminary findings suggest that dumping has taken place or a subsidy exists, causing injury to a domestic industry, and\n  * provisional measures are considered necessary to prevent injury while the remainder of the investigation is being conducted.\nThe Agreements also state that provisional measures cannot be applied before 60 days after the initiation of the investigation, and must be taken for the minimum time possible and not normally exceeding four months. In anti-dumping cases, provisional measures can be applied for up to six months where exporters representing a significant amount of the trade involved request it. In cases where a lower duty is applied than the margin of dumping these periods can be extended to six and nine months respectively.\nProvisional safeguard measures can also, under article 6 of the WTO Safeguards Agreement, be applied in critical circumstances where there is evidence that an unforeseen surge in imports have caused or are threatening to cause serious injury to a domestic industry. The duration of the provisional measure in a safeguards case is not allowed to exceed 200 days. The duration of any provisional measure counts towards the total period for which the safeguard may apply.\nWithin the framework set out by the WTO, provisional measures can be applied at different stages in the investigations process. For example, the US applies them after they have received data from respondents in an investigation, but before that data has been verified. The EU applies them after verification of the data has taken place. There is a balance to be struck between providing early protection for the domestic industry, and setting provisional measures at the appropriate level based on sound data.\nIf the investigation fails to find a justifiable case for the application of trade remedy measures, the investigation is terminated and provisional duties have to be repaid. On occasion, provisional duties imposed on an exporter are lower than definitive duties. In these cases the exporter is required to top up the difference. Similarly, any duties imposed as a result of provisional safeguard measures have to be promptly refunded to the exporter if the subsequent investigation does not determine that increased imports have caused or threatened to cause serious injury to a domestic industry or were not unforeseen.\nFor anti-dumping cases, provisional measures may take the form of a provisional duty or a security - by cash deposit or bond - equal to no more than the amount of the anti-dumping margin provisionally estimated. For anti-subsidy cases, provisional measures may take the form of provisional countervailing duties guaranteed by cash deposits or bonds equal to no more than the amount of the provisionally calculated amount of subsidisation. For safeguards, provisional measures should take the form of tariff increases.\nConcluding Trade Remedy InvestigationsOnce a final determination has been made in a trade remedies investigation, definitive measures can be applied. These are usually in the form of duties, undertakings, or occasionally in the form of tariff rate quotas (particularly for safeguards). These measures are applied at the border by HMRC.\nUndertakingsUndertakings can be an alternative to anti-dumping duties or countervailing measures (definitive or provisional).  In the case of dumped imports, these are generally price undertakings, whereby an exporter enters into a voluntary agreement to revise the export price of their product or cease exporting at dumped prices so as to eliminate the injury caused. In the case of subsidised imports, an exporter or the exporter’s government enters into a voluntary agreement to: a) eliminate or limit the subsidy or take other measures concerning its effects; or b) raise the export price of their product so as to eliminate the injury caused.  Undertakings do not apply in relation to safeguards. \nWhere undertakings are used, WTO rules set out procedures to follow.  Undertakings may only be offered or sought after a preliminary affirmative determination of dumping and injury caused.  When an undertaking is accepted, investigation proceedings may be terminated unless either the exporter (in anti-dumping cases) or exporter’s Government (in subsidies cases) want the investigation completed or if the investigating authority so decides.  If a negative determination of dumping or injury is subsequently made, the undertaking normally lapses.  If an affirmative determination is made, the undertaking remains in force.\nThere are no tariff measures that are placed as a result of undertakings\nReviewing casesThe decision to impose trade remedy measures has significant repercussions, both for the exporting industries whose business models will be directly impacted by the measures imposed, and for domestic industries and other interested parties within the receiving country. It is important, therefore, that a mechanism exists to review the measures in place, and that this mechanism is clear, transparent and effective, and allows measures only to continue as long as they are necessary.\nArticle 11 of WTO Anti-Dumping Agreement contains provisions relating to the duration and the review of measures. In the case  of dumping and subsidy, measures should remain in force no longer than is necessary to counteract the injury caused, and cannot be in force for longer than 5 years without being reviewed. Any review should normally be concluded within 12 months. In the case of safeguards, if the duration of the measure exceeds three years, then it should be reviewed not later than at the mid-point of the measure.  . Any measures in place for over 1 year should be progressively liberalised and no measures should be in place for more than 8 years in total.\nIn order to abide by these WTO requirements, the UK Government intends to create a trade remedies review process which is consistent with the approach to new investigations.\nMonitoring cases2.7.1   Circumvention \u0026 Absorption\nCircumvention and absorption both refer to practices which are designed to avoid anti-dumping or anti-subsidy duties and, if left unchecked, will undermine the effect of trade remedy measures.\n‘Circumvention’ refers to a process through which an exporter subject to anti-dumping or countervailing measure duties, or an importer liable to pay the duty, attempts to evade that duty through particular practices. In some instances these practices will be fraudulent activities for which there are separate HMRC enforcement provisions. Circumvention can take several forms including slight modifications of the product, transhipment via a third country, or assembly of the product in either a third country or the importing country with minimal value added.\nDuties are said to be ‘absorbed’ when, after anti-dumping or countervailing duties have been imposed, export prices decrease or the resale prices of the imported goods do not increase sufficiently, resulting in the measures not having the expected effect of restoring competitive prices.\nThe WTO Anti-Dumping and Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Agreements make no specific provision for circumvention or absorption reviews.  Most other countries’ trade remedies systems specify processes for reviewing cases and extending the anti-dumping measures as appropriate to tackle circumvention. For absorption, different trade remedies systems tackle the problem in different ways depending on the way in which duties are collected at the border of the country or region in question.\nThe UK Government intends to create an efficient and effective trade remedies framework should be robust enough to tackle these sorts of practices, which undermine the intended effect of the measures.\nMigrating cases\n\nAs per the earlier note on migrating cases, for an investigation to proceed, the companies requesting that investigation must account for more than 25% of total domestic production of the product in question. Their output must also exceed that of domestic producers that expressly oppose an investigation.\nThese criteria also apply when considering the migration of trade remedy cases from the EU to the UK. At the end of the implementation period, we will only transition the cases that meet these thresholds and which are seen to be in the public interest to maintain.\n\nAnti-dumping processes\nTrade remedy measures - overview\n        \n          \n\nID\n\nMeasure type\n\n# Regulations\n\n# Measures\n\n# Goods impacted\n\n\n552\n\nDefinitive anti-dumping\n\n136\n\n17,912\n\n18,767\n\n\n554\n\nDefinitive countervailing duty\n\n22\n\n9,453\n\n9,647\n\n\n570\n\nAnti-dumping / countervailing duty –   Control\n\n22\n\n451\n\n478\n\n\n566\n\nAnti-dumping / countervailing statistic\n\n1\n\n434\n\n453\n\n\n551\n\nProvisional anti-dumping duty\n\n2\n\n276\n\n276\n\n\n555\n\nAnti-dumping/countervailing duty -   Pending collection\n\n2\n\n143\n\n143\n\n\n565\n\nAnti-dumping / countervailing review\n\n13\n\n86\n\n96\n\n\n564\n\nAnti-dumping or countervailing   registration\n\n6\n\n48\n\n48\n\n\n562\n\nSuspended anti-dumping or duty\n\n1\n\n26\n\n26\n\n\n561\n\nNotice of initiation of an anti-dumping   or countervailing proceeding\n\n4\n\n13\n\n19\n\n        \n      \n\nThis table illustrates the current usage of measures within the UK (as shown on the UK Trade Tariff Service) related to Trade Remedies in descending order of usage\n Regulations denotes the number of active EU regulations that impact on the import of goods from outside of EU\n Measures denotes the number of individual ‘transactional’ measures that have been applied to importable goods\n Goods impacted denotes the number of commodity codes impacted\n\nMeasure typesDeclaration of subheading submitted to authorised use provisions (464)\n\nThese measures are applied whenever a differentiation is made in an anti-dumping case determination between the additional duties applicable for items destined for authorised use or standard use items. \nFor example, a definitive anti-dumping case may decide that the additional duty applies only when the importation purpose is not for authorised use. In cases such as this, an existing commodity code is split into two and the anti-dumping duty is applied to just one of the two.\nThis is illustrated in the case of regulation R0157/13 (“imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of bioethanol originating in the United States of America”) . As a result of this, commodity code “2207100017” (For other uses) was derived from the parent (already deeply branched) as distinct from commodity code “2207100012” (For use as fuel). \nThe anti-dumping duty (measure type 552) is placed on the non-authorised use code (“For use as a fuel”), whereas the code introduced for authorised use was assigned measure type 464 to indicate that an authorised use exemption was in place – no anti-dumping duty assigned to this commodity code.\nThese measures are for information purposes only: to end traders fill in their SAD forms and to provide ‘clear’ instruction as to the circumstances that allow them to avoid anti-dumping duty.\nAccording to the EU’s TARIC user guide, this is “to avoid a circumvention of the antidumping duties by declaring the wrong TARIC code”.\nThere is no clear requirement for this measure type to be persisted in the UK.\n\nProvisional anti-dumping duty (551)\n\nThe vast majority of these duties are assigned to a commodity with an additional code (to specify a specific company or a home company who is to be exempted of the duty) to assign an additional definitive punitive anti-dumping duty on a commodity.\nThis duty is applied on top of any existing tariffs (MFN or preferential) when import duty is calculated. Anti-dumping duties are raised when an overseas exporter is accused of ‘dumping’ their goods on a foreign market and this is deemed to have an injurious effect on producers in that market. Anti-dumping cases go through multiple phases with the culmination of the case resulting in a definitive duty being applied.\nProvisional duties are imposed when initial investigation (no less than 60 days from initiation of case) illustrates that the raised case is merited. From this point on, securities in the form of guarantees or bonds are required to be supplied by importers of such goods.\nCompared to definitive antidumping duties, there are very few provisional anti-dumping duties on the current database. This is because they are typically converted to definitive measures once the case has been fully and forensically examined and appeals have been heard.\nAlternatively, the measures could be dropped if found to be unsubstantiated.\nEither way, the measures are designed to be short-lived, temporary checks until a definitive judgment is reached. The effect is to bring about protection for struggling domestic industries, if this is required in advance of a definitive judgement.\n\nDefinitive anti-dumping duty (552)\n\nThese duties are assigned to a commodity and in most cases an additional code (to specify a specific company against which a punitive measure is ranged or a home company who is to be exempted of the duty) to assign an additional definitive punitive anti-dumping duty on a commodity.\nThis duty is applied on top of any existing tariffs (MFN or preferential) when import duty is calculated. Anti-dumping duties are raised when an overseas exporter is accused of ‘dumping’ their goods on a foreign market and this is deemed to have an injurious effect on producers in that market. Anti-dumping cases go through multiple phases with the culmination of the case resulting in a definitive duty being applied.\nEven though fault has been found with the overseas exporter, the duty is payable by the UK importer. The additional duty acts as a deterrent against trading with the offending business and helps to protect the interests of UK manufacturers in the same market.\nThere are 158 records in the database where an offending or exempted company is not specified in the associated additional code, compared to 18,000 records in total (data from 2019).\nWhere an additional code is not provided, measures are usually set to Erga Omnes to avoid circumvention by ensuring certain goods have high duties when imported from any country.\nThe term ‘definitive’ will be re-badged as ‘final‘ in the UK tariff.\n\nProvisional countervailing duty (553)\n\nCountervailing duties, also known as anti-subsidy duties (the name that will apply in the UK tariff), differ from anti-dumping duties in that they determine that the illicit trading activity has been the result of state subsidy rather than purely the actions of an individual business / businesses.\nThe net effect of countervailing duties is however very much the same as with antidumping duties.\nThe provisional stage requires that traders supply securities on importing impacted goods rather than payment in full.\nAs of 30/06/19 there are no such measures on the database – this is a matter of timing rather than anything else, as all provisional measures have been converted to definitive equivalents.\n\nDefinitive countervailing duty (554)\n\nCountervailing duties, also known as anti-subsidy duties (the name that will apply in the UK tariff), differ from anti-dumping duties in that they determine that the illicit trading activity has been the result of state subsidy rather than purely the actions of an individual business / businesses. The net effect of countervailing duties is however very much the same as with antidumping duties.\nCountervailing duties are linked to companies, however a single regulation (R1519/15) caused an ERGA OMNES countervailing duty to be raised to cover imports from the rest of the world (with the exception of specific offenders USA, Canada, Argentina, Indonesia).\nAs with anti-dumping duties, definitive countervailing duties represent the culmination of an upheld investigation into a complaint of illicit activity with a net result that importers are liable for the full amount of countervailing duty, rather than the security that had been imposed in the prior provisional phase.\nThe term ‘definitive’ will be re-badged as ‘final‘ in the UK tariff.\n\nAnti-dumping / Countervailing duty - Pending collection (555)\n\nThere are currently 96 measures of this type, derived from just 2 EU regulations (C0303/06 and D0223/14). The measures are linked to China, to which a definitive anti-dumping or countervailing duty has been assigned. Duty collection is suspended pending an examination into an exemption request.\nIn most cases, additional codes link to EU-based companies which have requested exemptions from the duties.\nEU companies are implicated in a form of circumvention of anti-dumping or countervailing duty by bringing component parts into the home market and then constructing finished or more complete goods from component parts.\nTherefore need specific exemptions to be able to import ‘dumped’ goods.\n\nNotice of initiation of an anti-dumping or countervailing proceeding (561)\n\nThese are introduced when the controlling authority (for the UK this will be the TRA) is alerted to the fact that there is reason to investigate potential dumping or illegal state subsidy and conclude that the case warrants proper investigation.\nWhen notices of initiation are first created, they have no end date against them: when the investigation reaches the point at which provisional duties are determined, the notice of initiation should be removed by setting the end date to the date of entry into force of the provisional duty measures.\nNotices of initiation are ranged against commodity codes only and for the country that is accused in the initial applicant’s case – not against additional codes at this stage as it is too early in the investigative process to determine any specific action against an individual company.\nThe measure is in any case not duty-bearing.\nThe net effect of the notice of initiation is statistical only – from this point all goods noted in the application will be surveilled in data captured via CDS and supplied back to the TRA for analysis.\n\nSuspended anti-dumping or countervailing duty (562)\n\nThese measures are derived from a single regulation, which initiated a review into the import of photovoltaic cells from Malaysia into the EU. To illustrate the rarity of this measure, this exemption applies to just one business across 26 commodity codes.\nIn the regulation which engendered these measures, a notice of initiation of review of exemption, a single applicant (Longi (Kuching)), an exporter of cells from Malaysia, but parented in China is referenced. While this review is taking place, the duties against the claimant are suspended, pending further investigation of the claimant’s case.\n\nAnti-dumping or countervailing registration (564)\n\nRegistration requests take place when a domestic producer is sufficiently concerned by the potential impact of an overseas manufacturer’s activity that they request for all imports of commodity codes to be registered, which means that duty can be retroactively applied to any imports from the date of registration if the case is upheld through provisional and definitive measures. \nIn practice, registration is most frequently requested as a result of circumvention. Circumvention is any activity designed to avoid the payment of anti-dumping or countervailing duties imposed on a particular product manufactured in and/or exported from a non-EU country.\nRegistration takes place to put in place immediate measure to help to dissuade circumvention.\n\nAnti-dumping/countervailing review (565)\n\nThere are multiple kinds of review that can be held with trade reviews. In most cases, the review type is an expiry review, which kicks in after the fourth year of an anti-dumping or countervailing case. However there are multiple reviews that can result in review-type measures being created.\nThe EU regulation that accompanies such a measure is entitled something like “ Notice of initiation of an expiry review of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of certain aluminium radiators originating in the People’s Republic of China” – the measures are assigned against commodity codes, not against additional codes.\nEach review is accompanied by a new piece of legislation (tertiary / public notice). This measure is for informational purposes only – there is no duty or operational impact of a review measure being created.\n\nChanges to measure type descriptionThe following changes will be required for measure type descriptions related to Trade Remedies – essentially, any reference to “countervailing” will be replaced by a reference to “anti-subsidy’ and any reference to “definitive” will be replaced by “final”.\n\n        \n          \n\nMEASURE TYPE ID\n\nDESCRIPTION (EU CURRENT)\n\nDESCRIPTION (UK FUTURE)\n\n\n552\n\nDefinitive   anti-dumping duty\n\nFinal   anti-dumping duty\n\n\n553\n\nProvisional   countervailing duty\n\nProvisional   anti-subsidy duty\n\n\n554\n\nDefinitive   countervailing duty\n\nFinal   anti-subsidy duty\n\n\n555\n\nAnti-dumping   / countervailing duty - Pending collection\n\nAnti-dumping   / anti-subsidy duty - Pending collection\n\n\n561\n\nNotice   of initiation of an anti-dumping or countervailing proceeding\n\nNotice   of initiation of an anti-dumping or anti-subsidy proceeding\n\n\n562\n\nSuspended   anti-dumping or countervailing duty\n\nSuspended   anti-dumping or anti-subsidy duty\n\n\n564\n\nAnti-dumping   or countervailing registration\n\nAnti-dumping   or anti-subsidy registration\n\n\n565\n\nAnti-dumping   / countervailing review\n\nAnti-dumping   / anti-subsidy review\n\n\n566\n\nAnti-dumping   / countervailing statistic\n\nAnti-dumping   / anti-subsidy statistic\n\n\n570\n\nAnti-dumping   / countervailing duty – Control\n\nAnti-dumping   / anti-subsidy duty – Control\n\n        \n      Additional duties (695)\n\n\nAdditional duties are imposed on imports of goods from overseas states in retaliation for trade activities that are seen to contravene WTO guidelines.\nThis may be as a result of a formal Trade Disputes case or as a safeguarding measure. There are very few measures of this kind of the EU database currently, however those that are present are all in response to behaviour from the USA, including the recent retaliation to President Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs in which 25% duties were raised against imports of those products from the EU, Mexico and Canada. The EU exacted revenge by imposing 25% duties on multiple US-sourced products including Harley Davidson (and other) motorcycles from the USA etc.\nDuties are also applied against imports of other US-sourced goods such as sweetcorn (maize), corrective glasses, denim and cranes\nAdditional duties are imposed on top of any other applicable duties, much in the way that anti-dumping and countervailing duties are added to the more standard duties.\n\nAt a glance:\n\n\nAdditional duties in form of ‘safe guards’\nApplied in retaliation to trade activities that are seen as not complying with WTO guidelines\nAdditional charge on top of standard duty\n\n","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-policy/trade-remedies.html"},"30":{"title":"Agricultural instruments","content":"Agricultural instruments\n\n\nIntroduction to agricultural instruments\n\n\nThe Meursing table and Meursing codes\n\n\n\n\nAbout Meursing codes\n\n\nThe Meursing table\n\n\nWorking out your Meursing code\n\n\nHow do Meursing codes impact duty calculations?\n\n\nMeursing additional codes\n\n\nHow the EU Taric Consultation facilitates Meursing\n\n\nThe future of Meursing … mixed\n\n\n\n\nSetting measures against Meursing codes\n\n\nCalculating Meursing duties on complex duties\n\n\nMeursing measure types \u0026 duty expressions\n\n\nThe reduction indicator and geographical areas\n\n\nA look at Meursing volumes \u0026 slices by country / reduction indicators\n\n\nReduction indicators apply constant reduction across all measures – Singapore FTA\n\n\nJapan has 6 reduction indicators on milk / milk fat content\n\n\nMeursing tables – data structure\n\n\nUnit prices (SPVs)\n\n\n\n\nFuture of the SPV \u0026 currency usage\n\n\nThe Entry Price System \u0026 SIVs\n\n\n\n\nStandard Import Values (SIVs)\n\n\nThe SIV without the Entry Price System\n\n\nThe relationship of SIVs to SPV\n\n\nSIVs and key origins\n\n\nThe Entry Price System in Action\n\n\nRepresentative prices for poultry\n\n\n\n\nHow Representative Prices work\n\n\nReducing representative prices under quota\n\n\nPrognosis for representative prices\n\n\nVariable duties for rice and cereals\n\n\n\n\nImport duties set by route into the Union\n\n\nIntroduction to agricultural instrumentsThere are 5 types of agricultural measure that you will need to be aware of, albeit not all are likely to be active in the UK tariff on day one. These are:\n\n\nThe Meursing table and Meursing codes\nUnit prices or Simplified Procedural Values (SPVs)\nThe Entry Price System \u0026 Standard Import Values\nRepresentative prices for chicken\nVariable prices for cereals and rice\n\nThe Meursing table and Meursing codesNote: Meursing is no longer part of the UK Tariff, so the below is for information only.\nAbout Meursing codes\n\nMeursing codes are used in the EU to apply specific duties to compound agri-goods (the official term for delicious cakes and biscuits), depending on the relative content of sugar, flour and milk starch / solids.\nMeursing codes were introduced to allow for cakes etc. to be taxed according to their ‘luxury’ value without there needing to be literally thousands of new commodity codes to be created to cater for the many permutations.\nThe EU has executed the revenue collection for such goods using Meursing additional codes.\nFor the best detailed view of Meursing codes, please see this blog by trade expert Peter Ungphakorn.\n\nThe Meursing table\n\nThe trader works out the constituent parts of sugar, butter etc, looks for the correct cell in the table below for their product’s recipe.\nThe then declares this number, prefaced by the Meursing identifier “7”, on their import declaration form, after which the duty is calculated in the border system.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/additional-commodity-code\nWorking out your Meursing code\nHow do Meursing codes impact duty calculations?\n\nIn UK parlance, the component parts are displayed using the three terms:\n\n\nAC – standing for “Agricultural Component”, means milk-based product (like butter)\nSD – standing for “Sugar Duty”\nFD – standing for “Flour Duty”\n\nIn the EU jurisdiction, these were respectively referred to as EA, ADSZ and ADFM, which are the French and German equivalents of AC, SD and FD (Elément agricole, Additional duties – Sucre Zucker, Additional duties – Farine, Mehl).\nIf a duty is displayed as 7.60% + EA (see product 1901200000 - right), this means that there is a simple ad valorem duty of 7.60% plus a variable component based on milk / butter content.\nThe trader can then look up the milk / butter content’s Meursing code, either by looking at the table, or by using the UK gov online service, and then work out the full duty.\nActually the EU’s Taric consultation is the best (until the end of the Implementation period), as the Meursing tool is semi-integrated into the standard tariff lookup.\n\n\nShowing 3rd country (MFN) duty for  product 1901200000 (Malt extract) on the Trade Tariff Service\nThe duty is not just a simple ad valorem or a specific duty based on a weight (or other unit). Instead, the import duties will depend on the %age content of milk protein \u0026 milk fat.\nhttps://www.trade-tariff.service.gov.uk/commodities/1901200000\nMeursing additional codes\n\nMeursing placeholders are ‘replaced’ by additional codes of a specific type (type 7)\nType 7 codes are stored in a different table from all other additional codes: it is not clear why\nDuties are assigned to the Meursing additional codes, not the commodities that might use them in their measures.\n\n\nHow the EU Taric Consultation facilitates Meursing\n\nOn the EU Taric Consultation site, which will be of no relevance to us after the end of the Implementation Period, the Meursing functionality is embedded into the standard tariff lookup function.\nAgain, with example product 1901200000, the trader first sees  the duty 7.60% + EA(1) - picture 1\nThen the trader either enters the %age components into a tool like the UK’s Meursing tool, or they enter the relevant 3 digit code from the Meursing table.\nThis then refreshes the page (picture 2) with an expanded duty. The specific duty of 117.85 EUR/100kg has been inserted to replace the “EA” placeholder\nBTW – the (1) in brackets refers to something called the reduction indicator – see later\n\n\nThe future of Meursing … mixedThis is an extremely complex process for traders, and almost impossible to marshal for Border Force, therefore the UK had taken the decision to abandon the Meursing system for No Deal – this may be reversed for the end of the Implementation period.\nCaveat 1 - While having no Meursing codes helps to simplify the UK tariff, it is only a partial saving grace, as there remains a requirement to include Meursing-related information in the reference document.\nThis is hugely problematic, as it defeats the point of using the actual UK tariff as the source for the reference document: the Meursing data needs to come from elsewhere – in this case from the live EU database. Perversely, if Meursings were to return, this would simplify document production.\nCaveat 2 – anything stated now may not be true by the end of the Implementation period.\nA recent Cabinet paper has identified that there will be a review of all agricultural instruments.\nSome interest has been shown in a simplification of the Meursing table, e.g. reducing the columns and rows to more manageable \u0026 intelligible options, but is unlikely to have been agreed before Jan 2021.\nCaveat 3 – the Northern Ireland Protocol means that NI traders in goods considered at risk will be subject to the full Union Customs Code (UCC), including the full set of applicable EU import duties.\nWhether this is deliverable by 2021 is in doubt.But the UCC includes Meursing, therefore some UK traders, and DDaT and DIT Policy team will need to understand this subject in depth.It is not going away.\nSetting measures against Meursing codes\n\nMeursing codes break the mould in nearly every way. Everything you have learnt about the tariff, relearn it for Meursing codes.\nFirst, these are the sole instances in the tariff of duties (measures and measure components) being assigned against an additional code alone, and not against a combination of commodity code and additional code.\nThe image below shows the absence of commodity code (goods_nomenclature_item_id) but presence of the Meursing additional code (7012)\n\n\n\n\nThe measure type of 674 indicates that this duty, once calculated with the specific ingredient percentages, will insert a duty to replace an EA (agricultural component) placeholder.\nThe duties assigned to this measure are highlighted in the image below.\nRead more about this in the measure components guide, which explains what all these fields mean in detail.\nBasically this means “add a duty equal to 17.18 Euros per 100kg (1 decitonne)” to any measure that includes an EA placeholder, regardless of the commodity code.\n\n\nCalculating Meursing duties on complex duties\n\nLet’s take this as an example – this is commodity code 1704905500 Throat pastilles and cough drops with a screen grab taken from the Trade Tariff Service.\nYes, we apply duties based on sugar and butter content on throat lozenges, imported from the Faroe Islands.\nThe trader sees the duty  0.00 % + EA MAX 18.70 % +ADSZ\nThis reads (in English) as:\n0.00% ad valorem (a reduction from the 9.00% of the MFN)\nPlus the agricultural component supplement\nUp to a maximum of 18.70% ad valorem …\nPlus the sugar component\nAt this point the trader does not know the values that will replace EA and ADSZ, so they look up their ingredient %ages and come up with a Meursing additional code 7507.\nThe trader sends comm code 1704905500 and additional code 7507 to CDS / CHIEF and they replace the EA \u0026 ADSZ placeholders with real specific duties (which they all are).\n\n\nHence, 0.00% + EA up to a MAX of 18.70% +ADSZ\nbecomes\n0.00% + 18.87 €/100kg up to a MAX of 18.70% + 99.88 €/100kg\nwhen the recipe is added. To reiterate: Meursing duties are applicable to the recipe, not the commodity; but they are only chargeable when replacing the placeholders in comm code duties.\nMeursing measure types \u0026 duty expressions\nThe reduction indicator and geographical areas\n\nMeursing code measures are typically assigned to the geographical area ID 1011 (Erga Omnes, the whole world).\nHowever, they can be assigned to other countries: in fact the following countries / groups have Meursing measures, allowing the EU to tailor duties to the individual countries:\n\n\n\n\nSo geographical areas add a further dimension to the management of Meursing-related duties.\nJust when you thought it could not get any more complex, along comes the reduction indicator.\nThe table on the previous page showed a pair of duty expressions that can be related to a Meursing-type measure\n\n\n\n\nThe second of these pairs (reduced additional duty on sugar / flour / agricultural component) allows the EU to assign effectively a different Meursing table\nThe reduction indicator can only be applied to preferential duties – i.e. it is never assigned to Erga Omnes (1011).\nThe reason for the reduction indicator is to provide a reduction on the base (non-reduced duty) for certain ranges of goods from a given country.\n\nA look at Meursing volumes \u0026 slices by country / reduction indicators\n        \n

type, concatenated with additional code (would reach all the way down to 996 with the same results)\ncolumn 2 – duties applicable that ‘recipe’ for the given axis (AC, SD or FD) under reduction indicator 1 (full duty, no reduction)\ncolumn 3 – duties applicable that ‘recipe’ for the given axis (AC, SD or FD) under reduction indicator 2 (preferential reduction on Meursing duties applies)\ncolumn 4 – shows that reduction indicator 2 brings in a duty that is 90% of the non-reduced version, across every permutation of measure type and ingredient axis, albeit there is a small error for rounding (specific tariffs are not usually captured in the tariff to more than 2 decimal places).\ncolumn 5 – rounds column 4 to one decimal place\n\nThe result is the same for all 1,512

content\n\n\nJapan’s FTA has these 6 reduction indicators that allow for differential %age to be reduced against different commodity codes.\nThe reductions are not sequential – i.e. the rates fluctuate in size.\nAnd there look to be errors in it – highlighted in yellow. It’s not clear why these values do not match the rubric.\nAnd the final bizarre thing: there are only 16 products that have Meursing duty expression, but more than 3,000 unique duties are set up.\n\nMeursing tables – data structure\nMeursing appears to have been tacked on to the basic tariff, as a lot of the principles that apply across the board otherwise have been abandoned.\nMost importantly, although they are treated as additional codes in assigning measures, they are stored in separate tables from all other such codes (and transmitted to HMRC as such).\nThe standard “type 1” naming convention \u0026 data structure has also been eschewed: \nmeursing_subgheadings contains the descriptions\nmeursing_heading_texts is used instead of the more standard meursing_heading_descriptioins\nUnit prices (SPVs)\n\nUnit price is a synonym for Simplified Procedural Value (SPV).\nIt is used for goods that are imported on consignment, i.e. they are yet to be sold, so they need a reference price to work out import duty and VAT.\nThe UK typically uses the term SPV, the EU typically uses the term Unit Price, but they are interchangeable.\nTraders can only use the SPV scheme for whole fruit and vegetable produce, of a single kind, imported on a consignment basis.\nSPVs are customs values derived from prices at which goods were sold on sales in specified markets within Europe. The prices gathered from across the EU are combined (through a process that is not understood in DIT) to form a single “Unit price”\nUnit prices are used on certain fruit and vegetables only (54 commodity codes at the time of writing)\nExcluded from the scheme are fruit or vegetable products that have undergone a cut and dicing process prior to importation.\nSPVs are updated by the EU fortnightly, starting midnight Thursday / Friday, while the UK still needs to work out the frequency with which we will update these values.\nFor SPVs (and SIVs) the unit of measure is always DTN (100kg or decitonne).\n\nExamples of commodity codes that are assigned Unit Prices are: garlic, cauliflowers, asparagus, carrots, peas, aubergine, celery, sweet peppers, beans as well as soft fruit such as plums, peaches, nectarines, strawberries etc.\nFuture of the SPV \u0026 currency usage\n\nThe SPV is expected to be widely used in the UK Tariff post-implementation period, as the requirement to divine a price for goods delivered on consignment will persist.\nWork will be required to understand how often the SPVs are to be updated (every 2 weeks in the EU).\nSPV are and will remain without exception aimed at Erga Omnes (1011 – the whole world) – there are no preferential instances of SPVs.\nSPVs use measure type 488 (Unit Price)\nThere are never any conditions associated with an SPV, just components identifying the specific import duty (e.g. 184.58 EUR (EUC) / 100 kg)\nIt is not clear why the EU uses the monetary unit EUC instead of just EUR. EUC stands for “Euro, according to Article 146 (2) of Regulation (EC) No 2015/2447”. This document is the EU legislation underpinning the UCC (Union Customs Code), and hints at the reason (right - i.e. usage of monthly conversion factor).\nThere remain outstanding questions on the future of currency in the management of import duties: EUROs will remain for the time being but may be replaced by sterling at some stage in the future.\n\nCHAPTER 3 - Currency conversion \nArticle 48 - Provisions on tariff exchange rate (Article 53 of the Code) \n1. The value of the euro, where required in accordance with Article 53(1)(b) of the Code, shall be fixed once a month. \nThe exchange rate to be used shall be the most recent rate set by the European Central Bank prior to the penultimate day of the month and shall apply throughout the following month. \nHowever, where the rate applicable at the start of the month differs by more than 5 % from the rate set by the European Central Bank prior to the 15th of that same month, the latter rate shall apply from the 15th until the end of the month in question.\n\n\nWhere the conversion of currency is necessary for any of the reasons referred to in Article 53(2) of the Code, the value of the euro in national currencies to be applied shall be the rate set by the European Central Bank on the first working day of October; this rate shall apply with effect from 1 January of the following year.\nMember States may maintain unchanged the value in national currency of the amount determined in euro if, at the time of the annual adjustment, the conversion of that amount, leads to an alteration of less than 5 % in the value expressed in national currency. \nMember States may round upwards or downwards to the nearest decimal point the sum arrived at after conversion \n\nThe Entry Price System \u0026 SIVs\n\nThe EU protects growers of 15 kinds of selected fruits and vegetables against international competition not only by the means of ad valorem tariffs of up to 20%, but also by the EPS.\nThe EPS came into effect on 1 July 1995\nAnalogous to a minimum import price, the EPS is designed to restrict imports below the product-specific, politically designated EP plus ad valorem tariff.\nIf the EP is undercut, an additional specific tariff is levied, which proportionally varies depending on the gap between the product’s actual import price and the EP.\nWhen the EP is undercut by 8% or more, the maximum specific tariff, referred to as the maximum tariff equivalent (MTE), of up to 80% of the EP is charged.\nFor example, the EPS is applied to oranges during the EU orange harvest season in the time period December 1 to May 31.\nThe MFN tariff for oranges seasonally varies between 3.2% and 16.0% whereas the MFN EP remains constant at a level of 354 €/t.\nIf oranges are exported to the EU at a price of 336.3 €/t, the EP is undercut by 5%.\nThis implies that the exporter has to pay an additional specific tariff of 17.7 €/t which is equal to the gap between the import price and the EP.\nIf the entry price for oranges is undercut by 8% or more, an additional specific tariff at the level of the MTE of 71 €/t is charged.\n\nStandard Import Values (SIVs)\n\nMonitoring compliance with the EPS faces the difficulty that a large share of fruit and vegetable imports in the EU is on commission, implying that the import price is not determined until the product is sold in the EU market.\nTherefore, the European Commission calculates a synthetic import price, the standard import value (SIV).\nFruit and vegetable prices, surveyed for each product and export country individually, are collected on representative fruit and vegetable wholesale markets in all EU Member States (for example New Covent Garden Market in the UK).\nThe daily SIVs are calculated as a weighted average of collected wholesale market prices, less a marketing and transportation margin and applied tariffs.\nDIT has not been made aware of the specific calculations that will be undertaken to manage the SIV, as this is a Defra responsibility\nIt is also not 100% clear as to what the future of the SIV in the UK will be, not for that matter the Entry Price System as a whole.\nThe EPS was designed as a protectionist measure for EU growers – during growing season they had to sell their goods or see them rot: outside that season, the EPS is not applied. The UK does not have the same climate, nor therefore the same agricultural sensibilities.\n\n\n\n\nTherefore the expectation is that the EPS will be abandoned in the UK (needs to be validated, and may well change through the Transition Period).\nHowever, the SIV must stay for tax calculation and reporting purposes.\n\nThe SIV without the Entry Price System\n\nIf there is no Entry Price System, then the SIV will need to persist regardless. This is because it offers traders a way of valuing their goods for import duty and VAT calculation perspective.\nLet’s say a consignment of sweet oranges arrives from overseas to be sold on New Covent Garden Market. At the point of arrival into the UK, it does not have a sale price.\nAnd yet, there will possibly be a desire to impose some kind of import duty (dependent on trade policy) and there will also be a desire to calculate a VAT surcharge.\nIn actual fact, VAT on such goods in the UK is 0% and the likelihood of the UK imposing import duties on goods we do not grow in the UK (to industrial volumes) is small, therefore the taxation \u0026 revenue aspect of the SIV is apparently negligible.\nHowever, the VAT calculation still needs to know the ‘value’ of the goods to do its 0% calculation, therefore some yardstick (the SIV) is required.\nMoreover for reporting purposes, the SIV allows statistical analysis of the value of imports to be carried out: without a nominal value this would not be possible.\nOne could argue that, without the Entry Price System, the SIV is precisely the same as the SPV (Unit Price), as the purpose, mechanic and impact would be identical.\nHowever they are legislated for separately and the UK is reserving the right to bring back the EPS, therefore the distinction is likely to remain.\nDefra need to be consulted on this, as it is a changing area\n\nThe relationship of SIVs to SPV\n\nThere are 7 commodity codes (data from 2019), where both SIVs and SPVs apply (below).\nThe two pivot tables below show the usage of SPVs and SIVs throughout a year on commodity code 0805102200 (Sweet oranges).\nThe tables show that the SIV applies while the EPS is running (in the EU) and the SPV applies when it does not, according to European growing (marketing) seasons. SPV and SIV are never concurrent on the same commodity code.\n\n\nSIVs and key origins\n\nThe Entry Price Systems is not one-size fits all. There are multiple countries which have specific SIVs that differ from the SIV applied to MFNs (this is never the case with SPVs).\nFor example, on the commodity below (Monreales – 0805220011 [a type of clementine]), there are multiple geography-specific SIV rates, as per the image below, showing the applicable measures for Israel (which has its own SIV for monreales), compares to the SIV for Erga Omnes.\nThis is a reflection of the prices of goods when they are gathered in the EU markets on a per origin basis.\nThe following slide shows the countries which have their own SIV values (2019 Jan 1st onwards).\nErga Omnes (1011) has full coverage, while other nations’ SIVs are very specific, e.g. for Australia, the EU has SIVs solely for apples\n\n\n\nThe Entry Price System in Action\n\nThe screen grab below shows a fragment of the page on the Trade Tariff Service for the import of Cider apples (0808108010).\nThere are two rows that are interesting. First, the SIV itself for Erga Omnes\nSecondly, the third country duty – in most cases, a third country duty is not conditional: it is applicable to all trades in goods from non-preferential zones.\nOn goods where the EPS applies, the third country duty is dependent on the import price, which, if the good is brought in on consignment, may be determined by the SIV.\n\n\n\n\n\nClicking on “Conditions” shows the condition mechanic – this is described in more detail in the guide on measure conditions, but the meaning of this page is as per the preamble on the workings of the EPS.\nThe applicable duties for the import of a good are inversely proportional to the declared import price – i.e. the lower the import price, the higher the duties, according to pre-set thresholds.\nThe duty is expressed in terms of a flat ad valorem and a specific: typically it is just the specific duty which changes, though here, if the good is imported at a very low price, then the duties are waived entirely.\nThe system is tightly balanced, showing the precarious nature of Southern European agri-business, with the thresholds being respectively 98, 96, 92, 90, 88 and 86% of the zero-duty reference price.\n\n\nRepresentative prices for poultry\n\nRepresentative Prices for Poultry are a type of special agricultural safeguard, protecting the domestic market from influx of cheap imports of poultry products at high volume.\nThe world chicken market is highly competitive and there are certain countries which would be able to gain a complete hegemony in poultry trade if safeguards were not applied. In the world of poultry, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Thailand are far and away the biggest exporters and therefore these safeguard measures are applied solely to their exports.\nRepresentative prices differ for different origins. While these have been calculated by DG Agri in the European Commission, and the UK has been able to vote on the representative prices, we nor other individual member states are involved in the calculation, nor understand how they are calculated.\nRepresentative prices an be raised at any time and the prices and trigger tiers are modified regularly (once a month for chicken products).\nThere are also representative price measures for molasses, but this function has been dormant for a number of years, therefore does not need to be considered for the UK tariff.\n\nHow Representative Prices work\n\nThe concept behind representative prices for poultry is very similar to the Entry Price System for Fruit and Vegetables, however there are a number of additional operational challenges that traders face in importing goods against this regime.\nBelow is a view of the measures that are associated with the import of boneless chicken cuts (0207141000) from Argentina.\nAll 5 of these measures contribute to the duties and securities that will be required of a chicken importer.\nUnder a No Deal, this trade safeguard would have been abandoned in the UK, but it is potentially back on the table.\n\n\n\n\nThe first measure to be looked at is the representative price measure itself (measure type 489).\n\n\n\n\nThis is similar in purpose to the Standard Import Value measure (490) used for fruit \u0026 veg – it sets an expected acceptable import price for a good.\nAs per the regulation covering this, which is refreshed on a regular basis in the EU:\nThe representative prices […] shall be determined at regular intervals (monthly) taking into account in particular:\n\n\nthe prices on third country markets\nfree-at-Community-frontier offer prices\nprices at the various stages of marketing in the Community for imported products.\n\nThe importer may choose to use the “representative price” method to calculate import duty on their goods.\nOr, at the request of the importer, the additional duty may be established on the basis of the CIF import price of the consignment in question, if this price is higher than the applicable representative price.\nThe application of the CIF (cost, insurance \u0026 freight) import price of the consignment for establishing the additional duty is subject to the presentation of multiple documents including the purchasing contract (to prove value).\nThe importer must lodge a security (deposit)  equal to the amount of additional duty which he would have paid if the calculation of the additional duty had been made on the basis of the representative price applicable to the product in question.\nSo here is the second of the five measures explained (measure type 653):\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, border authorities do not trust that the goods being brought in are going to be sold at the value documented on the purchasing contract: securities are lodged until the importer can prove that they are not lying.\nThe importer has one month from the sale of the products in question to prove that the consignment was disposed of at the stated price.\nFailure to meet the deadline means they lose the security lodged. But if they can prove sale conditions matched those declared, then securities are returned.\n\n\nHow to calculate applicable duties\n\n\nIf the difference between the (representative) trigger price and the import price:\n is less than or equal to 10 % of the trigger price, no additional duty shall be imposed;\n is greater than 10 % but less than or equal to 40 % of the trigger price, the additional duty shall equal 30 % of the amount by which the difference exceeds 10 %;\nis greater than 40 % but less than or equal to 60 % of the trigger price, the additional duty shall equal 50 % of the amount by which the difference exceeds 40 %, plus the additional duty allowed under (b);\nis greater than 60 % but less than or equal to 75 %, the additional duty shall equal 70 % of the amount by which the difference exceeds 60 % of the trigger price, plus the additional duties allowed under (b) and ©;\nis greater than 75 % of the trigger price, the additional duty shall equal 90 % of the amount by which the difference exceeds 75 %, plus the additional duties allowed under (b), © and (d).\nSo here is the third measure that is applied – measure type 652, Additional duty based on cif price.\n\n\nWe actually do not need to worry too much about this calculation, but at least it helps to clarify the stepped thresholds applied on such conditional measures.\n\nDuty calculation using measure conditions\nThe five thresholds that were noted on the previous page (derived from the controlling EU regulation) are represented by measure conditions with price thresholds.\nThe mechanisms are almost identical to the Entry Price’s thresholds (which use condition code V). These use condition code L, which essentially references the CIF price instead.\nDuties are then applied in inverse relation to the declared import price.\n\nReducing representative prices under quota\n\nThe final two measures allow a trade in poultry under representative prices to be reduced by way of a quota – or, in this case, two licensed quotas for the import of poultry products.\nThis sets a further threshold whereby the representative price and associated securities do not kick in until the quota is exhausted / licences allocated and used.\nThese quotas behave much in the way of existing quotas, but do use specialised measure types (653 and 654)\n\n\nPrognosis for representative prices\n\nUnder No Deal, representative prices for chicken would have been dumped as a trade instrument. However, as a consultation is now going out to ask traders what they think of the EU tariff, all best are off.\nThe UK may be required to support this function, hence the detailed explanation\n\nVariable duties for rice and cereals\nSituation in the EU\nThe types of cereals covered by this system are: durum wheat, high quality common wheat, rye, maize, sorghum.\nThe duty to be applied will be the difference between an EU reference price of €157.03/tonne (155% of the EU intervention price) and the cost of delivering the consignment in question to an EU port (including cost, insurance and freight). However, that duty may not exceed the WTO bound rate of duty set out in the Common Customs Tariff. \nThe Commission carry out a daily calculation, though the rate fixes if not changed significantly against mean for 10 days.\n\nUK prognosis\nIt is likely that the UK will not vary duties on cereals, but will retain the legal capability.\nImport duties set by route into the Union\n\nThe screen grab below shows commodity code 1007900000 (Grain sorghum – a type of millet)\nYou can see that there are 3 additional codes assigned to the commodity code that must be used by traders in these goods to identify the route taken to get the goods into the Union.\nYou can also see that the duties are all 0.00%, meaning that the differentiation is of little value.\nIn fact, variable duties for cereals exists in name \u0026 (dormant) legislative power only – the EU has not operationalised these powers for some time, and the UK has (at the last count) no intention of operationalising it.\nAs always with agri measures, please keep close to the situation in case it changes. We are likely to legislate for this, but not use it in anger.\n\n\nVariable duty for rice\n\nSituation in the EU\nCurrently includes Husked (brown) rice (excluding husked basmati rice), Semi-milled/milled (white) rice.\nImport duties for husked and semi-milled/milled rice are fixed on the basis of the level of import licences issued in the preceding 12 and 6 month period respectively.\nRice Marketing year runs from 1 September – 31 August\nThis is executed in the tariff as a standard Third country tariff.\n\nPrognosis for the UK\nAs with ‘variable’ duties for cereals, this simply does not change frequently: in addition, as this solely uses simple third country duties (type 103), there is no special mechanism for DDaT or tariff managers to be concerned with.\n","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-policy/agricultural-instruments.html"},"31":{"title":"Import \u0026 export control","content":"Import \u0026 export control\n\n\nIntroduction to import and export control\n\n\n\n\nMeasure types and measure type series\n\n\nRestrictions\n\n\nWhy there are so many import control measures … ME32\n\n\nJams, fruit jellies, marmalades …\n\n\nTypes of export control\n\n\n\n\nECJU controls\n\n\nFuture of import and export control\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to import and export control\n\n\nThe list of measure types on the previous page may appear overwhelming, however it is reassuring that there is a huge degree of similarity between literally all of these measures – they all involve the same data objects and the same system usage.\nThere are two axes to be aware of, as follows:\n\n\nImport vs export\nProhibition vs restriction\n\nIn terms of data setup, there is no difference whatsoever for tariff users determining import versus export: the import versus export differentiator is set up as a part of the measure type (i.e. just once)\nfor prohibition versus restriction, the difference is that prohibitions are finite: they cannot be overcome via the use of documentation (e.g. certificates / licenses), whereas for restrictions, these are always accompanies by conditions: the trader can complete the import if certain conditions are fulfilled, usually by accompanying the trade with some kind of documentation.\n\n\nMeasure types and measure type seriesAccording to the Tariff guide, prohibitions and meant to be set up using measure type series ‘A’ and restrictions using measure series ‘B’. While this is honoured for some prohibitions this has been somewhat loosely observed. Hence, the following measure types exist as ‘true’ prohibitions according to the measure types series:\n\n\n277 Import prohibition\n278 Export prohibition\n\nThe following measure types, which behave as prohibitions, are set up with measure type B:\n\n\n724 Import control of fluorinated greenhouse gases\n745 Import control on cat and dog fur\n740 Export control on cat and dog fur\n749 Export control of mercury\n\nRestrictions\n\nMost restrictions are simple – they describe a measure type that has been applied to a commodity code from a given date (usually unterminated), which is then assigned a small number of conditions that describe how the trader can make the trade succeed, e.g. by supplying a document of some sort.\nIn most cases, the restrictions is set up as a pair of items:\n\n\none describing what should happen if the conditions are fulfilled\nthe other describing what happens if the conditions are not fulfilled\n\nBelow is the simplest of all – import control on cat and dog fur.\nSome are vastly more complex – much more definition of the complexity and logic is included in the training guide to measure conditions.\n\n\n\nImport control on cat and dog fur\nThis shows a pair of conditions: at the top the success condition and beneath it the failure condition. In this case, success if a specific “document code” is fulfilled.\nThis is actually not a document at all, rather an indication as to which types of pelt are included in the restriction.\nWhy there are so many import control measures … ME32“There may be no overlap in time with other measure occurrences with a goods code in the same nomenclature hierarchy which references the same measure type, geo area, order number, additional code and reduction indicator. This rule is not applicable for Meursing additional codes.”\nJams, fruit jellies, marmalades …\n\n\nAs a tariff manager, I have been asked to create a new measure for ERGA OMNES of type “Import control” at level 4 “with a sugar content exceeding 30% by weight” – \nThere is already a measure of type “Import control” at level 8 “Fruit purees obtained by sieving then brought to the boil in a vacuum, the texture and chemical composition of which have not been changed by the heat treatment”\nME32 says no\nI can either rejig the measures in the entire hierarchy to suit to new measure OR …\nI can invent a new measure type “Import control for sieved fruit puree” … which is what the EU has done, and which we will also need to do in the future.\n\n\nTypes of export controlECJU controls\n\nA significant stakeholder in the management of UK export controls was the ECJU or Export Control Joint Unit in DIT.\nThe ECJU is in charge of a number of export controls (and as the name suggests - no export controls), as follows:\n\n\nUK Military goods list, UK Dual Use list\nUK Radioactive Sources Goods list\nEU Torture Goods Regulation list\nEU Firearms Regulation list\nEU Dual Use Regulation list\nSanctions - Democratic People’s Republic of Korea\nSanctions -  Iran (Sanctions) (Nuclear)\nSanctions - Libya\nSanctions - Russia\nSanctions - Syria\nProhibition on Internal Repression goods\nProhibition on Interception and Monitoring goods\nThis is a mixture of sanctions due to country-specific policies (e.g. export sanctions against Iran, Libya and Syria) or commodity-related measures, such as controls related to military and dual use goods.\n\nThe ECJU is responsible for some sanctions, but not all: for example the Foreign Office is also responsible for a number of sanctions not covered in this list, such as those against Venezuela, Sudan and South Sudan.\nIn preparation for EU Exit November 2019, the ECJU did a lot of work trying to understand the truth behind the EU’s measures and found a lot of issues with the EU’s data. Work was done to\n\n\na) correct the footnotes\nb) identify the commodities that should really be impacted\n\nhowever the volume of work to fully isolate what was meant to change for the UK was too much to achieve in the prep time available, such as the measure types that were to be assigned and most importantly, the certification – safest was to leave it.\n\nFuture of import and export control\n\nIt is fair to say that there is a huge amount of complexity in the volume and variety of import and export controls.\nSo much so that the decision was taken during 2019 to essentially not address any of the import and export measures, with the exception of a very few, which we knew would no longer apply.\nFor No Deal 2019, it was critical to ensure that we did not introduce friction at the border by bringing in new / modified certification needs, therefore we left well alone.\nThis meant that, barring c. 5 exceptions, all import and export control measures were terminated (as EU measures) and restarted as UK measures, inclusive of the conditions, certificates and footnotes.\nA more root and branch review would have followed at a later date when the pressure of ‘Brexit day’ was off.\n\n","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-policy/import-\u0026-export-control.html"},"32":{"title":"Most favoured nation duties","content":"Treating other countries equally: most favoured nation\n\n\nExceptions to most favoured nation\n\n\nFree trade agreements\n\n\nTrading with developing nations\n\n\nTrade barriers\n\n\n\n\nCreating MFN duties in the tariff\n\n\nWhere to attach MFN duties in the commodity code hierarchy\n\n\nAttaching MFN duties to a geographical area\n\n\n\n\nMost favoured nation (MFN) is a principle of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nIt means members of the WTO cannot usually discriminate between their trading partners.\nCountries must offer access to their market on the same terms for all members of the WTO.\nAny favour offered to one country must be offered to everyone.

An end-line is the most specific classification of a product.\nEach end-line has an MFN duty attached to it.\nOften, the MFN duty is 0%. But it does not matter what the duty is, it must be set against the commodity code in the tariff.\nWhere to attach MFN duties in the commodity code hierarchyYou can attach the MFN duty to any tier in the commodity code hierarchy. All the codes below it in the hierarchy inherit the same duty.\nFor example, the commodity code for Natural Chilean sodium nitrate is 3102500010.\n\nThis is made up of:\n\n\nHS chapter: 31 Fertilisers\nHS heading: 02 Mineral or chemical fertilisers, nitrogenous\nHS subheading: 50 Sodium nitrate\nCN subheading: 00 (not set)\nTaric code: 10 Natural Chilean sodium nitrate\n\nIf the MFN duty on ‘31 Fertilisers’ is 0%, all the codes below it in the hierarchy inherit the 0% MFN duty.\nRead more about commodity codes.\nAttaching MFN duties to a geographical areaYou must create all MFN duties (103s and 105s) against ‘Erga Omnes’.\nErga Omnes is a Latin phrase which means ‘towards all’ or ‘towards everyone’.

Such a measure, of any of the three types, is set up as follows:\n\n\n\nThe three data items highlighted in yellow above are critical here.\nThe duty_expression_ID field has a value of 99, which means that the expression is a supplementary unit\nThe measure type ID in the measures table identifies that this is a supplementary unit: it will nearly always be of type 109.\nThe measurement_unit_code field in the measure_components table will identify the unit that the trader has to submit on their declaration form – here, NAR means “Number of items”, which also applies to other ‘semantically’ similar units, such as number of head for cattle.\nThe measurement_unit_qualifier_code field is almost always null, but may be used to qualify the primary unit (e.g. KGM E)\n\nCredibility checks\n\nThe EU Commission was not satisfied that the Member States were applying the right quality of checks on the declarations coming into their countries, so they centrally imposed measures to help assure quality – and imposed measures to check on the member states. These are called credibility checks.\nThese checks are ‘blocking’ checks, inasmuch as they cause the declaration to be rejected if the check is failed.\nAn example of a credibility check measure is measure type 482, which requests that a country’s border system compares the weight of a good against the submitted ‘supplementary unit’, for example number of head of cattle.\nThe credibility checks that were created by the European Commission are a tiny subset of what HMRC have created on CHIEF, which performs a large number of checks on data quality within declarations,\nWhen CDS goes live, it will also feature a large number of data quality rules which will supersede these credibility checks. and, will transfer to CDS.\nIt is the role of HMRC in conjunction with Border Force to impose quality measures on the border systems, and therefore it is unlikely any new measures of this type will be created and it may be the case that the measures of this type that already exist will no longer be used post-Brexit\nHowever we need to ensure we keep the existing measures in place until there is no doubt that we are fully extricated from Europe\nIf there is a requirement to create new credibility checks measures in the future, then it is anticipated that these will be communicated via offline methods to HMRC from the instituting source (e.g. Defra / DIT) and then entered directly into the risking module that is part of CDS, rather than being passed through the DIT Tariff Application\nHowever, as with a number of things at the moment, the requirements of the Northern Ireland Protocol may scupper this desire to remove credibility checks entirely.\n\nSurveillance measures\n\n\nThese measure types are not going to be carried forward in the UK tariff, but are used by the EU to monitor trade.\nThese are not to be confused with Trade Remedies-related surveillance measures, which are put in place in order to track the trade in goods that are being investigated for Trade Remedy infraction.\nThese trade remedy measures are also not to be carried forward.\nIn all cases, there are better ways of surveilling and reporting on trade. The only purpose for these measure types is to ensure that the EU can centrally impose surveillance measures across each of the 28 member states.\n\n","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-policy/miscellaneous-measures.html"},"34":{"title":"Suspensions and reliefs","content":"Suspensions and reliefs\n\n\nIntroduction to suspensions and reliefs\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between reliefs and suspensions?\n\n\nPossible process\n\n\nKeep an eye on suspensions over 2020\n\n\nCurrent EU suspensions\n\n\nFuture UK reliefs\n\n\n\n\nRegistered aircraft relief\n\n\nPharmaceutical relief\n\n\nVessels relief\n\n\nAuthorised release relief\n\n\nRelief on certain types of aircraft\n\n\nIntroduction to suspensions and reliefs\n\nAs of Feb 2020, the plan is for the UK to make drastic changes to the way in which suspensions / reliefs are made available to traders on the Tariff.\nThe UK is not legislating for suspensions in the event of a No Deal – at least that was the plan if there had been a No Deal in Nov 19 or Jan 20. This may change in the course of 2020.\nIndeed, there is a plan to launch a suspensions consultation late in 2020 to allow UK traders to identify digitally the products on which they want suspensions to be applied, which at least suggests that there will be a suspensions regime in place at the end of the Implementation Period.\nThere are already many suspensions in the EU tariff, as described in later slides. In the event of a No Deal, the UK will be retaining some of these, but in the form of reliefs.\n\nWhat is the difference between reliefs and suspensions?\n\nIn terms of their operation on the tariff, nothing at all.\nA suspension and a relief both reduce the duties on the import of a good to zero or a significantly reduced rate upon invocation by the trader. A suspension is intended to be temporary; a relief could be permanent, though in the EU there is no differentiation – they are all called suspensions (in the UK they would all be reliefs).\nThe trader needs to actively indicate on their declaration that they would like to take advantage of a suspension / relief and provide the necessary documentation to back this up – this is typically an authorised use certificate or similar.\nThe reason for the authorised use certificate is that suspensions and reliefs are designed to provide impetus to domestic industries which cannot source enough or sufficiently affordable component parts, ingredients or raw materials from the home market to remain a viable industry. Therefore they make a request to the authoritative body (the European Commission / UK Government) for a suspension / relief to remove / reduce import duties on overseas goods.\n\nPossible process\n\nThe main difference between suspensions and reliefs is their permanence and the legislative structures that underpin them.\nTemporary tariff suspensions are designed to allow manufacturing industries within the EU / UK to compete on equal terms with non-domestic producers of finished products whereas reliefs are permanent (until forcibly ended).\nFormally, suspensions are typically in place for 5 years before review, but in the Tariff, there are no end dates on suspensions.\nThe process by which traders request access to new suspensions is yet to be defined, however broadly speaking it will be something like that to below (massively over-simplified to show impact on tariff only).\n\n\nKeep an eye on suspensions over 2020\n\nThis is an area that will evolve significantly in terms of thinking over the year.\nIn the lead-up to (the abortive) No Deal(s), suspensions were not legislated for, partially because the goods on which suspensions would have been applied were all covered by the Unilateral Liberalisation (all duties being reduced to zero, except a select few sensitive lines, negotiating capital and Trade Remedy-impacted products).\nIn a No Deal scenario, EU suspensions were mutated to reliefs in certain circumstances\nIt is not clear if this will be the case at the end of the Implementation Period.\n\nCurrent EU suspensionsThe following measure types exist on the EU tariff, which will continue to apply to the UK in full until the end of the Implementation Period. Had No Deal happened, all such measures would have been terminated on Day -1.\n\n        \n          \n\nMeasure type ID\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n112\n\nAutonomous   tariff suspension\n\n0%   duties on miscellaneous goods for which suspensions have been formally agreed   by the European Commission.

In a “No Negotiated Outcome” scenario, we would need to ask the question is this relief and all others actually required if we return to the idea of unilateral liberalisation, as all codes covered by this and the other reliefs will be universally 0%, regardless of the relief applied.\nPharmaceutical relief\n\n\nNew relief type will apply to any commodity that currently has the additional code of 2500 attached to it.\n2500 represents “Annex I “Combined Nomenclature”, Part Three, Section II (pharmaceutical products), Tariff Annexes 3 to 6 – R 2019/1776 (OJ L 280)”, which is a list of commodity codes which, if imported for specified pharmaceutical purposes, can attract a 0% import duty, but if not assigned the 2500 code (i.e. 2501 – Other) attract a higher duty, dependent on the commodity code.\nThe use of the additional code will need to continue for these measures, as this is the only way in which the differentiation between uses can be represented by the trader.\nThe way in which we put in place our MFN strategy will define if we need to use these measures straightaway: for instance if there is a period of unilateral liberalisation, then the pharma relief may be useless (all covered goods will be 0% any way)\nIf no unilateral liberalisation, we will need to revisit the approach again:\n\n\nshould we do as the EU does and create 2 MFN duties per commodity, one with relief attached, the other without\nor, do we use the measure type.\n\n\nVessels relief\nAny commodity that previously had measure type 117 Suspension - goods for certain categories of ships, boats and other vessels and for drilling or production platforms attached to it.\nOf all the names selected for new measure types, this is the one that would appear to require most attention.\nAuthorised release relief\nThis is assigned to any commodity that previously had measure type 119 Airworthiness tariff suspension.\nThis name has been provided by the policy team, so should be considered safer than some of the others.\nRelief on certain types of aircraft\nAssigned to any commodity code that previously had measure type 115 (Autonomous suspension under end-use) attached to it and contains the phrase ‘certain types of aircraft’ in its description\n","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-policy/suspensions-and-reliefs.html"},"35":{"title":"Unilateral preferences","content":"Unilateral preferences\n\n\nWhat are unilateral preferences?\n\n\nThree GSP tiers\n\n\nOwnership of Unilateral Preferences\n\n\nAbout Standard GSP (GSP General Framework)\n\n\nBeneficiaries of GSP General Framework\n\n\nAbout GSP+ (GSP Enhanced Framework)\n\n\nAbout Everything But Arms EBA (GSP LDC Framework)\n\n\nVolatility of GSP frameworks\n\n\nEconomic Partnership Agreements (EPAs)\n\n\nTransitional Protection Measure (TPM)\n\n\nUnilateral preference measures\n\n\nWhat are unilateral preferences?\n\nAs the name suggests, unilateral preferences represent favourable treatment afforded to third countries under certain circumstances with no expectation that the providing country will get any preferential treatment / market access in return.\nMany developed nations have adopted one form or another of a unilateral preference programme in order to remove or reduce import duties from products coming into their domestic market from vulnerable developing countries. This helps developing countries to alleviate poverty and create jobs based on international values and principles, including labour and human rights.\nThe EU has approached this goal by adopting the idea of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP): the UK will adopt this after EU Exit.\n\n\nGeneralised System of Preferences (GSP)\n\n\nThe Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), instituted in 1971 under the aegis of UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development), has contributed over the years to creating an enabling trading environment for developing countries.\nThe following 13 countries/blocs grant GSP preferences: Australia, Belarus, Canada, the European Union, Iceland, Japan, Kazakhstan, New Zealand, Norway, the Russian Federation, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States of America.\n\nThree GSP tiers\nOwnership of Unilateral Preferences\n\nThe primary remit for Unilateral Preferences falls to DFID, the Department for International Development.\nThere is then a dotted line into DIT and a very close working relationship.\n\n\nAbout Standard GSP (GSP General Framework)Standard GSP reduces EU import duties for about 66% of all product tariff lines.\n\nConditions\n\n\nAny developing country will benefit from Standard GSP unless:\n\n\nit has another type of special trade access to the EU granting the same tariff preferences as the scheme, or better, for substantially all trade\nit has achieved a high- or upper-middle income economy status during three consecutive years according to the World Bank classification\n\n\nThe EU can withdraw Standard GSP in exceptional circumstances, notably serious and systematic violation of fundamental human rights and labour rights conventions.\n\nProduct graduation\n\n\nSome developing countries export highly competitive products, which do not need preferences to successfully access world markets (e.g. India and Indonesia).\nIn that case GSP is withdrawn from these product sectors through a graduation mechanism (see EU website for details)\nThe EU reviews the list of graduated products every three years through an implementing regulation and on the basis of objective criteria.\nThe UK will adopt all of these features post-Implementation period.\nProduct graduation only applies to the General Framework, not the other two tiers.\n\nTariff reduction under GSP Standard Framework is rules-driven\n\n\nThe import duties applicable to countries trading on GSP Standard Framework are not negotiated or subject to whim\nThey are calculated as percentages of the prevailing MFN, according to the type of product\nThe EU’s “REGULATION (EU) No 978/2012 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 25 October 2012 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 732/2008” explains this rather well.\nThis regulation differentiates between sensitive and non-sensitive products: sensitive products being those that are key to sectors within the EU’s manufacturing base.\nCommon Customs Tariff duties on non-sensitive products are suspended in full, while duties on sensitive products enjoy a tariff reduction.\nad valorem duties are generally be reduced by a flat rate of 3.5 percentage points from the ‘most favoured nation’ duty rate, while ad valorem duties for textiles and textile goods are reduced by 20%.\nSpecific duties are reduced by 30 %.\nWhere a minimum duty is specified, that minimum duty does not apply.\nDuties are suspended totally, where the preferential treatment for an individual import declaration results in an ad valorem duty of 1 % or less or in a specific duty of EUR 2 or less, since the cost of collecting such duties might be higher than the revenue gained.\nWhile this is rules-driven, the complexity of building a rules-driven service for the Tariff Application is yet to be attempted. This will feature on the backlog at some time.\n\nBeneficiaries of GSP General FrameworkThe following countries are beneficiaries of the GSP General Framework – this is the list of countries that would have gone live in a November 2019 No Deal for GSP General Framework.\n\nAbout GSP+ (GSP Enhanced Framework)The special incentive arrangement for Sustainable Development and Good Governance GSP+ grants full removal of tariffs on over 66% of EU tariff lines.\n\nConditions\nTo be eligible for GSP+, the country must lodge an application and fulfil the Standard GSP conditions and the following two additional criteria:\n\n\nVulnerability criteria\nIn order to qualify for GSP+, a beneficiary country has to fulfil the vulnerability criteria – the country must be recognised as globally weak in terms of export on goods subject to GSP+ reductions and sufficiently diverse in its export capability across GSP+ categories\nSustainable development criteria\nThe country must have ratified the 27 GSP+ relevant international conventions on human- and labour rights, environmental protection and good governance.\n\n\nMonitoring\nOnce a country is granted GSP+, the EU monitors that the beneficiary country abides by its commitments\n\nBeneficiary countries\nThe following countries will be members of GSP+\n\n\nArmenia\nBolivia\nCape Verde\nKyrgyzstan\nMongolia\nPakistan\nPhilippines\nSri Lanka\n\nAbout Everything But Arms EBA (GSP LDC Framework)\n\nEverything but Arms (EBA) is an initiative of the European Union under which all imports to the EU from the Least Developed Countries are duty-free and quota-free, with the exception of armaments. EBA entered into force on 5 March 2001.\nArms are available in Chapter 93 of the goods classification (under the harmonised system), meaning that every one of the other chapters 91 to 98, except chapter 77) is duty- and quota-free.\nA country is being granted EBA status if it is listed as a Least Developed Country (LDC) by the UN Committee for Development Policy.\nCountries do not need to apply to benefit from EBA, they are added or removed to relevant list through a delegated regulation.\nEBA preferences can be withdrawn in case of some exceptional circumstances, notably in case of serious and systematic violation of principles laid down in fundamental human rights and labour rights conventions (see article 19 of Regulation (978/2012).\nUnlike under the Standard GSP, countries do not lose EBA status by entering into a Free Trade Agreement with the EU. A ‘graduation mechanism’ for products also does not apply.\n\n\nVolatility of GSP frameworks\n\nCountries do move in and out of GSP frameworks as their economies progress or recede, or if they fail to adhere to conditions of membership, e.g. human rights.\nHowever these changes are both rare and predictable, as they are telegraphed months or years ahead of the event.\nThe following changes have occurred recently:\n\n\nEquatorial Guinea will leave its current lowly ranking in the LDC category and exit GSP altogether in December 2020, as it has been classified by the world-bank as a high income economy in 2015 and as an upper-middle income economy in 2016 and 2017.\nSamoa joined the general framework on Jan 1st 2019, having been ‘promoted’ from LDC.\nParaguay left the GSP scheme altogether on Dec 31st 2018, as the country has been classified by the World Bank as upper-middle income country in 2015, 2016 and 2017\nGhana left the GSP scheme altogether on Dec 31st 2018\nSwaziland (Eswatini) left the GSP scheme altogether on Dec 31st 2018\nCôte d’Ivoire left the GSP scheme altogether on Dec 31st 2018\n\n\nEconomic Partnership Agreements (EPAs)\n\nEconomic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) are trade and development agreements negotiated between the EU and African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) partners, aimed at promoting trade and to foster sustainable development and poverty reduction.\nIn actual fact, EPAs are identical in nature to the EU’s FTAs and are discussed in that document: they are discussed here due to joint ownership with DFID and the sustainability / developmental nature of their being.\nThe UK will adopt all of these, though the component countries will depend on who signs when, and the international political standing of these states – for example, it is not thought that the Comoros Islands will be included in the ESA EPA.\nThe following EPAs exist:\n\n\nCentral Africa (Cameroon)\nEastern and Southern Africa (Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Seychelles , Zimbabwe)\nEast African Community (Kenya)\nSouthern African Development Community (Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Eswatini)\nWest Africa (Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana)\nCaribbean (CARIFORUM)\nPacific (Fiji, Samoa and Papua New Guinea)\n\nSee https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/development/economic-partnerships/index_en.htm for more\n\nTransitional Protection Measure (TPM)\n\nThe TPM or Transitional Protection Measure was to be put in place prior to the previous No Deals to make up for the fact that there had been insufficient time to transition a number of EPAs with African states.\nWhile the fundaments had not been agreed, it was felt that to leave these states, some of which are members of the Commonwealth, with no advantageous trade deal, would be a political own goal.\nThe countries that would have joined the TPM are:\n\n\nCameroon\nCôte D’Ivoire (Ivory Coast)\nGhana\nKenya \nZimbabwe\n\nIt remains to be seen if there is a need for the TPM at the end of the Implementation Period – it may well be that all EPAs have been transitioned.\nThe nature of the EPAs is, from a tariff duty perspective, identical to Everything But Arms (EBA) as applies to the LDC countries, i.e. full tariff removal on all goods except weaponry (chapter 93).\n\nUnilateral preference measures\n\nAll GSP measures are essentially tariff preferences – of type 142 and 145\nThe fact that they are unilateral makes no difference to the Tariff.\n142 = standard tariff preference measure\n145 = tariff preference under end use (authorised

(TRQs) are a form of preferential tariff.\nThey allow traders to import limited amounts of certain goods at lower or no rates of duty during a set period.\nHow traders choose between a preferential tariff rate and a tariff rate quotaPreferential tariffs and TRQs may exist on the same commodity code.\nWhether the trader uses the preferential tariff or the TRQ in their declaration depends on:\n\n\nwhether there is a quota balance available\nhow they complete the customs declaration (known as the single administrative document or SAD)\n\nIntroducing the benefits of a trade agreement over time: stagingUsually preferential tariffs and tariff quotas are brought in over time.\nThis is achieved via a process called staging.\nStaging is applied to preferential tariffs and TRQs in different ways.\nPreferential tariff stagingOften, trade agreements agree to reduce duty rates over several years. This is to protect domestic producers.\nFor example, here are 2 fragments from a trade agreement.\nThe first image shows the complex legal text which explains that:\n\n\ncommodity codes covered by the agreement have been given a number to indicate which ‘staging category’ they are in\ncustoms duties will be removed from these codes in a number of equal stages, depending which staging category they are in\n\nThe second image shows:\n\n\na list of commodity codes and the ‘staging category’ they are in\nthe starting rate of duty, which will reduce over time\n\n\nThe following example illustrates a reduction in duty rates over 7 years. During this period, duty rates are reduced from the starting rate to zero.\nIn 2013, when importing this product, the rate was 1.000 EUR per kg plus 24.000 EUR per 100kg.\nThe following year, the rate was 0.80 EUR per kg plus 20.60 EUR per 100kg.\nThis reduced steadily over the next 6 years until in 2020 the duty rate was zero.\n\nTariff rate quota stagingThe volume of imported goods allowed into free circulation at a reduced rate goes up by a set amount per year.\nFor example, this image shows a table which illustrates staging of a tariff rate quota between 2013 and 2020.\nIn 2013 the volume of imported goods allowed into free circulation at a reduced rate was 2,334,000 kgm.\nIn 2014 there was a big jump up to 6,160,000 kgm.\nBetween 2015 and 2020 the volume of imported goods allowed into free circulation increased by 560,000 kgm each year.\nIn 2020, the final year of staging, the volume of imported goods allowed into free circulation was 9,520,000 kgm.\n\nHow to assign tariff preference measures in the tariffAssign tariff preference measures to commodities using measure types:\n\n\n142 - Tariff preference\n145 - Preference under end-use (authorised use)\n\nRead about the components which make up a measure.\nHow to integrate preferential quota measures in the tariffTo integrate preferential tariff measures use the measure types:\n\n\n143 - Preferential tariff quota\n146 - Preferential tariff quota under end use\n\nRead about what makes up a quota.\n","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-policy/free-trade-agreements.html"},"37":{"title":"Retaliatory measures","content":"Retaliatory measures\n\n\nHistory of retaliatory measures\n\n\nRetaliatory measures by example: EU regulation R0886/18\n\n\nHistory of retaliatory measures\n\nSince 2006, the EU and the US have been waging trade wars against each others which have resulted in tit-for-tat duties being applied to goods coming from one party to the other.\nThese are expressed as ‘retaliatory measures’ on the Tariff in the form of measures of type 695.\nThese have only ever been levied against the USA, are very sparse and are mostly now historical.\nBelow is a list of the regulations that the EU has created with “695” measures in. The ones that are emboldened are the ones which are still relevant.\nEven within these R1906730 terminates at the end of April 2020, so there is unlikely to be an equivalent in place at the end of the Implementation Period. This document is interesting – it represents something called the Byrd Amendment1: a WTO judgment that allowed the EU and 7 other nations to retaliate against the US for failing to comply with its international trade obligations.\nIn effect, this added a 0.0001% surcharge on pre-existing duties on a number of products. Had we suffered a No Deal at the end of November 2019, these Byrd amendment duties would not have been carried forward anyway. All other retaliatory duties would have been retained.\n\n\nRetaliatory measures by example: EU regulation R0886/18\n\n\nIt all comes back to POTUS and his illegal manipulation of the world steel \u0026 aluminium trade via the imposition of punitive duties on most overseas exporters of steel.\n On 8 March 2018 the United States adopted safeguard measures in the form of a tariff increase on imports of certain steel and aluminium products, effective from 23 March 2018 and with an unlimited duration. After two deferrals of the effective date of the tariff increase with respect to the European Union, the tariff increase became effective with respect to the European Union on 1 June 2018, with an unlimited duration.\nAs a result, the EU were permitted by the WTO to impose retaliatory duties of type 695 on USA on certain products that were considered important to the US economy – you do not retaliate like for like: you aim to deliver a retaliation that is commensurate and of roughly equal material value. Therefore the duties were applied to products such as maize, fabricated machine parts, motorcycles and US whisky.\nRetaliatory measures are some of the simplest to construct, consisting of typically simple ad valorem duties assigned en masse to a number of commodities.\nThey are also very rare.\n\n","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-policy/retaliatory-measures.html"},"38":{"title":"Tariff data structures","content":"Tariff data structures","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-data-structures.html"},"39":{"title":"Origin quotas","content":"Origin quotas\n\n\nExample of an origin quota\n\n\nAnatomy of an origin quota\n\n\nWorked example\n\n\n\n\nOrigin quotas are preferential quotas that relax the rules of origin for a commodity up to a specified import volume. A certificate condition is often attached to the quota for this purpose, and the rate is the same as the non-quota preference. They are sometimes called derogations.\nExample of an origin quotaIn the EU-South Korea trade agreement, there is a rule of origin:\n\n        \n          \nHS heading\nDescription of product\nWorking or processing, carried out on non-originating materials, which confers originating status\n\n2402\nCigars, cheroots, cigarillos and ciga­rettes, of tobacco or of tobacco substitutes\nManufacture in which at least 70% by weight of the unmanufactured tobacco or tobacco refuse of heading 2401 used is originating\n\n        \n      And there is also an origin quota:\n\n        \n          \nHS heading\nDescription of product\nWorking or processing, carried out on non-originating materials, which confers originating status\nAnnual quota for exports from Korea into the EU\n\n2402 20\nCigarettes containing tobacco\nManufacture from materials of any heading, except that of the product\nAnnual quota of 250 Metric tons\n\n        \n      Anatomy of an origin quota\n\ng\n\n\n\nQuota\n\nQuota\n\n\n\nQuotaDefinition\n\nQuotaDefinition\n\n\n\nQuota--QuotaDefinition\n\n\n\n\nGeographicalArea\n\nGeographicalArea\n\n\n\nQuota--GeographicalArea\n\n\n\n\nMeasure1\n\nMeasure\nType: Pref. quota\n\n\n\nMeasure1--Quota\n\n\n\n\nMeasure1--GeographicalArea\n\n\n\n\nCommodity1\n\nCommodity\n\n\n\nMeasure1--Commodity1\n\n\n\n\nCertificate\n\nCertificate\nType: U (Proof of origin)\n\n\n\nMeasure1--Certificate\n\n\n\n\nMeasure2\n\nMeasure\nType: Pref. quota\n\n\n\nMeasure2--Quota\n\n\n\n\nMeasure2--GeographicalArea\n\n\n\n\nCommodity2\n\nCommodity\n\n\n\nMeasure2--Commodity2\n\n\n\n\nMeasure2--Certificate\n\n\n\nAn origin quota is composed of a quota associated with a number of commodities via measures. The quota is just a normal first-come first-served quota and as usual requires a quota order number beginning 05.\nWhat is different about an origin quota is that the measures associated with the quota each have a measure condition that require the use of a certificate. The certificate should be of type U (Proof of origin) and should contain text that specifies that part of the trade agreement legal text that mentions the origin quota.\nThe condition code for the measure condition is type Q (import due to a special license). The measure conditions are set up as:\nQ: Presentation of an endorsed certificate/licence\n\n        \n          \nDocument code\nRequirement\nAction\n\nUxxx\nProof of origin containing the following statement in English: “Product originating in accordance with Section x of Annex xxx”\nApply the mentioned duty\n\n\nNo document provided\nMeasure not applicable\n\n        \n      Worked exampleIn the trade agreement with the EU, an origin quota is made available for tuna loins:\n\n        \n          \nHarmonised system classification (2017)\nProduct description\nAlternative product-specific rule\nAnnual quota for exports from the Union to the United Kingdom (net weight)\nAnnual quota for exports from the United Kingdom to the Union (net weight)\n\n1604.14\nPrepared   or   preserved   tunas, skipjack and bonito (Sarda spp.), whole or in pieces (excl. minced)\nCC\n3,000 tonnes\n3,000 tonnes\n\n1604.20\nOther prepared or preserved fish\n\n\n\n\n\nOf tuna, skipjack or other fish of the    genus    Euthynnus    (excl. whole or in pieces)\nCC\n4,000 tonnes\n4,000 tonnes\n\n\nOf other fish\n-\n-\n-\n\n        \n      Heading 1604.14 (a.k.a commodity code 1604 14 00 00) specifies an annual volume of 3,000 tonnes. Heading 1604.20 does not have a quota specified against the code itself, and most importantly nothing is specified against its subdivision “of other fish”. The quota therefore only applies to the one child “… of the Euthynnus genus”. This corresponds to commodity code 1604 20 70 00 in the current nomenclature.\nAs the two quotas are independent (trades from one does not remove volume from the other) and because they have different volumes, two different quota order numbers are needed. As the origin quotas are defined in the same table they can use a certificate with the same description.\nThis results in the following tariff data objects:\n\n\nEU Tuna Origin quota anatomy\n\n\n\nQuota1\n\n\nQuota\n059161\n\n\n\n\n\nQuotaDefinition1\n\nQuota definition\nVolume: 3000 TNE\nDates: 1st Jan 2021 – 31st Dec 2021\n\n\n\nQuota1--QuotaDefinition1\n\n\n\n\nGeographicalArea\n\nGeographical area\nEuropean Union (1013)\n\n\n\nQuota1--GeographicalArea\n\n\n\n\nQuota2\n\n\nQuota\n059162\n\n\n\n\n\nQuotaDefinition2\n\nQuota definition\nVolume: 4000 TNE\nDates: 1st Jan 2021 – 31st Dec 2021\n\n\n\nQuota2--QuotaDefinition2\n\n\n\n\nQuota2--GeographicalArea\n\n\n\n\nMeasure1\n\nMeasure\nType: Pref. quota (143)\n\n\n\nMeasure1--Quota1\n\n\n\n\nMeasure1--GeographicalArea\n\n\n\n\nCommodity1\n\n\nCommodity\n1604 14 00 00\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasure1--Commodity1\n\n\n\n\nCertificate\n\n\nCertificate\nU178\nProof of origin containing the following statement in English:\n“Product originating in accordance with Section 1 of Annex II-A”\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasure1--Certificate\n\n\n\n\nMeasure2\n\nMeasure\nType: Pref. quota (143)\n\n\n\nMeasure2--Quota2\n\n\n\n\nMeasure2--GeographicalArea\n\n\n\n\nCommodity2\n\n\nCommodity\n1604 20 70 00\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasure2--Commodity2\n\n\n\n\nMeasure2--Certificate\n\n\n\n\n","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-data-idioms/origin-quotas.html"},"40":{"title":"Steel safeguard","content":"Steel safeguard\n\n\nCategories\n\n\nGeography\n\n\nQuarterly behaviour\n\n\nPost-exhaustion\n\n\nVolume carry-over\n\n\n\n\nData anatomy\n\n\nQuarter 4 quotas set-up\n\n\n\n\nSteel safeguards aim to prevent dumping of steel-based products by placing a cap on the volume of steel that can be imported. The cap is fine-grained and is controlled on a quarterly basis.\nA safeguard set-up is made up of a punitive duty that applies to all imports and then a quota that can override that duty for a set quarterly import volume. Once the quota is exhausted, the punitive duty applies and the import of steel products is strongly abated.\nThe override behaviour is not possible using the regular tariff rules and preference codes have to be used to allow the override to happen.\nCategoriesProducts to which safeguards are applied are split into several categories.\n\n        \n          \nNumber\nProducts\nPost-exhaustion quotas\n\n1\nNon Alloy and Other Alloy Hot Rolled Sheets and Strips\nIndividual\n\n2\nNon Alloy and Other Alloy Cold Rolled Sheets\nShared\n\n4A\nMetallic Coated Sheets\nShared\n\n4B\nMetallic Coated Sheets\nIndividual\n\n5\nOrganic Coated Sheets\nNone\n\n6\nTin Mill Products\nShared\n\n7\nNon Alloy and Other Alloy Quarto Plates\nShared\n\n12\nNon Alloy and Other Alloy Merchant Bars and Light Sections\nShared\n\n13\nRebars\nShared\n\n14\nStainless Bars and Light Sections\nShared\n\n15\nStainless Wire Rod\nShared\n\n16\nNon Alloy and Other Alloy Wire Rod\nNone\n\n17\nAngles Shapes and Sections of Iron or Non Alloy Steel\nShared\n\n19\nRailway Material\nShared\n\n20\nGas Pipes\nNone\n\n21\nHollow Sections\nShared\n\n25A\nLarge Welded Tubes\nShared\n\n25B\nLarge Welded Tubes\nShared\n\n26\nOther Welded Pipes\nShared\n\n27\nNon Alloy and Other Alloy Cold Finished Bars\nNone\n\n28\nNon Alloy Wire\nShared\n\n        \n      One quota then applies for each category for each quarter such that all the products in that category draw down from the same volume.\nFor each product in a category therefore receives one measure for the safeguard and then another measure for that category’s quota.\nGeographyNot all countries are subject to measures – certain developing countries are exempt. The group “Countries subject to safeguard measures (5050)” therefore does not include them.\nThere is also a list of countries that are exempt only for certain categories:\n\n        \n          \nCategory\nBrazil\nChina\nIndia\nSaudi Arabia\nThailand\nTurkey\nUkraine\nUAE\nVietnam\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n2\nX\n\nX\n\n\n\nX\n\nX\n\n4A\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n4B\n\nX\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7\nX\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n12\n\nX\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n\n\n\n\nX\nX\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\n25A\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25B\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n26\n\nX\nX\n\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\n27\n\nX\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n28\n\nX\n\n\nX\nX\n\n\n\n\n        \n      Where the country has an “X” then it is subject to safeguards in that category. Where the country has a blank then it is exempt from safeguards in that category.\nSome of the big exporters in each category get quotas of their own. As well as there being a quota for “all countries” there can also be separate quotas for individual geographies. These big exporters are therefore exempt from the all countries quota.\nQuarterly behaviourSafeguard quotas are defined on a quarterly basis, with “quarter 1” being from July–August and the next quarters continuing from there.\nThe same quota order numbers are used across each quarter but the volume is refreshed, apart from in quarter 4 which has special behaviour:\n\n\nQuotas for specific countries retain their quota order number in Q4 (so these quota order numbers are used all year).\nQuotas for “all countries” get a new quota order number in Q4 because of the exhaustion mechanism below.\n\nPost-exhaustionWhen the quota for a specific country is exhausted in Q4, a “post-exhaustion” quota opens which uses a completely separate quota order number. The country may shares this post-exhaustion quota with the other countries listed specifically apart from in categories 1 and 4B where it will have a post-exhaustion quota of its own.\nThe “post-exhaustion” quota is linked to the “all countries” quota for Q4 and can draw down from the all countries volume. The maximum volume they can draw may be capped at some percentage of the all countries volume (but this cap does not mean they are entitled to that volume).\nFor example, if the all countries volume has an initial volume of 1,000 tonnes, the post-exhaustion quota can be given a volume of 700 tonnes so that it only has 70% of the volume available. If all the other countries have used 400 tonnes then there will only be 600 tonnes left in the shared quota despite the volume of the country-specific post-exhaustion quota being 700 tonnes. The country would therefore only be able to use a maximum of 600 tonnes.\nThe “post-exhaustion” mechanism isn’t used for categories 5, 16, 20 and 27 - once the country-specific quotas are used there is no further volume available.\nVolume carry-overAny remaining volume left in quota pots in Q3 is automatically added on to quota volumes in Q4 (this is handled by downstream border systems and so doesn’t require changes to tariff data).\nData anatomyThis diagram shows a slightly simplified example of a commodity that is subject to steel safeguards. The key features of this example hypothetical category are:\n\n\nIndia is exempt from the category – and is therefore excluded from both the safeguard measure and quota.\nTurkey is a big exporter – it receives its own quota and is exempt from the “all countries” quota.\nThere is only one commodity – bigger categories will have more than one and all will link to the same quotas.\n\nThe quota definitions are not shown but would as discussed span a single quarter of the year. The measures are valid for as long as the same quota order number is in use – for categories where a different quota number is used for Q4, they would be valid from Q1 to Q3. The safeguard measure does not have an end date.\n\n\nSteel safeguard anatomy\n\n\n\nQuotaSpecific\n\nQuota\nOrigin: Turkey (TR)\n\n\n\nMeasureSpecific\n\nMeasure\nType: Non-preferential quota (122)\nOrigin: Turkey (TR)\n\n\n\nQuotaSpecific--MeasureSpecific\n\n\n\n\nQuotaAll\n\nQuota\nOrigin: Countries subject to safeguards (5050)\n\n\n\nMeasureAll\n\nMeasure\nType: Non-preferential quota (122)\nOrigin: Countries subject to safeguards (5050)\nExclusion: Turkey (TR), India (IN)\n\n\n\nQuotaAll--MeasureAll\n\n\n\n\nQuotaRegulation\n\nRegulation\nGroup: Non-preferential quotas (KON)\n\n\n\nMeasureSpecific--QuotaRegulation\n\n\n\n\nMeasureAll--QuotaRegulation\n\n\n\n\nSafeguardMeasure\n\nMeasure\nType: Additional duties (safeguard) (696)\nOrigin: Countries subject to safeguards (5050)\nExclusion: India (IN)\nAmount: 25.00%\n\n\n\nSafeguardRegulation\n\nRegulation\nGroup: Safeguard (TXC)\n\n\n\nSafeguardMeasure--SafeguardRegulation\n\n\n\n\nCommodity\n\nCommodity\n\n\n\nCommodity--MeasureSpecific\n\n\n\n\nCommodity--MeasureAll\n\n\n\n\nCommodity--SafeguardMeasure\n\n\n\nQuarter 4 quotas set-upThis diagram shows the way in which Q4 post-exhaustion quotas are associated with all country quotas, with quarter 3 on the left provided for reference.\n\n\n","url":"/tariff-data-manual/documentation/tariff-data-idioms/steel-safeguard.html"},"41":{"title":"Home","content":"HomeWelcome to the Tariff Manual!\n","url":"/tariff-data-manual/"}}}
